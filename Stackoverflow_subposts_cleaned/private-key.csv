Generate rsa keys by OpenSSL

Using OpenSSL on the command line you’d first need to generate a public and private key, you should password protect this file using the -passout argument, there are many different forms that this argument can take so consult the OpenSSL documentation about that.
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024

This creates a key file called private.pem that uses 1024 bits. This file actually have both the private and public keys, so you should extract the public one from this file:
openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout

or

openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout > public.pem

or

openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem


You’ll now have public.pem containing just your public key, you can freely share this with 3rd parties.
  You can test it all by just encrypting something yourself using your public key and then decrypting using your private key, first we need a bit of data to encrypt:

Example file :
echo 'too many secrets' > file.txt

You now have some data in file.txt, lets encrypt it using OpenSSL and
the public key:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey public.pem -pubin -in file.txt -out file.ssl

This creates an encrypted version of file.txt calling it file.ssl, if
you look at this file it’s just binary junk, nothing very useful to
anyone. Now you can unencrypt it using the private key:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in file.ssl -out decrypted.txt

You will now have an unencrypted file in decrypted.txt:
cat decrypted.txt
|output -> too many secrets


RSA TOOLS Options in OpenSSL

NAME

rsa - RSA key processing tool

SYNOPSIS

openssl rsa [-help] [-inform PEM|NET|DER] [-outform PEM|NET|DER] [-in filename] [-passin arg] [-out filename] [-passout arg] [-aes128] [-aes192] [-aes256] [-camellia128] [-camellia192] [-camellia256] [-des] [-des3] [-idea] [-text] [-noout] [-modulus] [-check] [-pubin] [-pubout] [-RSAPublicKey_in] [-RSAPublicKey_out] [-engine id]

DESCRIPTION

The rsa command processes RSA keys. They can be converted between various forms and their components printed out. Note this command uses the traditional SSLeay compatible format for private key encryption: newer applications should use the more secure PKCS#8 format using the pkcs8 utility.

COMMAND OPTIONS
-help


Print out a usage message.

-inform DER|NET|PEM


This specifies the input format. The DER option uses an ASN1 DER encoded form compatible with the PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey or SubjectPublicKeyInfo format. The PEM form is the default format: it consists of the DER format base64 encoded with additional header and footer lines. On input PKCS#8 format private keys are also accepted. The NET form is a format is described in the NOTES section.

-outform DER|NET|PEM


This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the -inform option.

-in filename


This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard input if this option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be prompted for.

-passin arg


the input file password source. For more information about the format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl.

-out filename


This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard output if this option is not specified. If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for. The output filename should not be the same as the input filename.

-passout password


the output file password source. For more information about the format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl.

-aes128|-aes192|-aes256|-camellia128|-camellia192|-camellia256|-des|-des3|-idea


These options encrypt the private key with the specified cipher before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for. If none of these options is specified the key is written in plain text. This means that using the rsa utility to read in an encrypted key with no encryption option can be used to remove the pass phrase from a key, or by setting the encryption options it can be use to add or change the pass phrase. These options can only be used with PEM format output files.

-text


prints out the various public or private key components in plain text in addition to the encoded version.

-noout


this option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.

-modulus


this option prints out the value of the modulus of the key.

-check


this option checks the consistency of an RSA private key.

-pubin


by default a private key is read from the input file: with this option a public key is read instead.

-pubout


by default a private key is output: with this option a public key will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the input is a public key.

-RSAPublicKey_in, -RSAPublicKey_out


like -pubin and -pubout except RSAPublicKey format is used instead.

-engine id


specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause rsa to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default for all available algorithms.

NOTES
The PEM private key format uses the header and footer lines:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

The PEM public key format uses the header and footer lines:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

The PEM RSAPublicKey format uses the header and footer lines:
-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----

-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----


The NET form is a format compatible with older Netscape servers and Microsoft IIS .key files, this uses unsalted RC4 for its encryption. It is not very secure and so should only be used when necessary.
Some newer version of IIS have additional data in the exported .key files. To use these with the utility, view the file with a binary editor and look for the string ""private-key"", then trace back to the byte sequence 0x30, 0x82 (this is an ASN1 SEQUENCE). Copy all the data from this point onwards to another file and use that as the input to the rsa utility with the -inform NET option.

EXAMPLES
To remove the pass phrase on an RSA private key:
 openssl rsa -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

To encrypt a private key using triple DES:
 openssl rsa -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:
  openssl rsa -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

To print out the components of a private key to standard output:
  openssl rsa -in key.pem -text -noout

To just output the public part of a private key:
  openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem

Output the public part of a private key in RSAPublicKey format:
  openssl rsa -in key.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out pubkey.pem

","A .crt stores the certificate..  in pem format.  So a .pem, while it can also have other things like a csr (Certificate signing request), a private key, a public key, or other certs, when it is storing just a cert, is the same thing as a .crt.
A pem is a base 64 encoded file with a header and a footer between each section.
To extract a particular section, a perl script such as the following is totally valid, but feel free to use some of the openssl commands.
 perl -ne ""\$n++ if /BEGIN/; print if \$n == 1 && /BEGIN/.../END/;"" mydomain.pem

where ==1 can be changed to which ever section you need.  Obviously if you know exactly the header and footer you require and there is only one of those in the file (usually the case if you keep just the cert and the key in there), you can simplify it:
 perl -ne ""print if /^-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\$/.../END/;"" mydomain.pem

","For general information: by default to ssh-connect you may simply use
user: vagrant password: vagrant
https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes/base.html#quot-vagrant-quot-user
First, try: to see what vagrant insecure_private_key is in your machine config
$ vagrant ssh-config

Example:
$ vagrant ssh-config
Host default
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 2222
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile C:/Users/konst/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL

http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/ssh_config.html
Second, do:
Change the contents of file insecure_private_key with the contents of your personal system private key
Or use:
Add it to the Vagrantfile:
Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|
  config.ssh.private_key_path = ""~/.ssh/id_rsa""
  config.ssh.forward_agent = true
end


config.ssh.private_key_path is your local private key
Your private key must be available to the local ssh-agent. You can check with ssh-add -L. If it's not listed, add it with ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Don't forget to add your public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the Vagrant VM. You can do it by copy-and-pasting or using a tool like ssh-copy-id (user: root password: vagrant port: 2222) ssh-copy-id '-p 2222 root@127.0.0.1'

If still does not work try this:

Remove insecure_private_key file from c:\Users\USERNAME\.vagrant.d\insecure_private_key
Run vagrant up (vagrant will be generate a new insecure_private_key file)

In other cases, it is helpful to just set forward_agent in Vagrantfile:
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
   config.ssh.forward_agent = true
end

Useful:
Configurating git may be with git-scm.com
After setup this program and creating personal system private key will be in yours profile path: c:\users\USERNAME\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
PS: Finally - suggest you look at Ubuntu on Windows 10

","for me, this was resolved by changing the permissions on .ssh folder in vagrant home directort (i.e. ""~vagrant/.ssh""). I think I messed up the permissions when I was setting up ssh keys for my application.
It seems that 'authorized_keys' file must be 'rw' only for 'vagrant' user so ""chmod 600 authorized_keys""; the same goes for the directory itself and its parent:
so:
chmod 600 authorized_keys
chmod 700 .
chmod 700 ..

It was only after I had all these permissions restored that vagrant ssh started to work again.
I think it's something to do with ssh security. It refuses to recognise certificates if they are any way accessible beyond the current user, so vagrants attempts to login are thus rejected.

","If you are using default SSH setup in your VagrantFile and started seeing SSH authentication errors after re-associating your VM box due to crash, try replacing public key in your vagrant machine.
Vagrant replaces public key associated with insecure private key pair at each log out due to security reasons. If you didn't properly shut down your machine, public/private key pair can go out of sync, causing SSH authentication error.
To resolve this issue, simply load up the current insecure private key and then copy the public key pair into your VM's authorized_keys file.

I switched to the password authentication by adding the following commands in Vagrantfile:
config.ssh.password = ""vagrant""
config.ssh.insert_key = false

Note that I'm not sure that this is the only changes required because I already did:

I generated a new RSA key pair and changed authorized_keys file accordingly (all in the virtual machine, see the suggestions above and elsewhere)
I copied the private key to the same directory where Vagrantfile resides and added 
 config.ssh.private_key_path = ""./id_rsa""


But I believe that these changes were irrelevant. I spent a plenty of time trying, so I did not change the working configuration by obvious reasons :)

create a folder. e.g F:\projects
Open this folder in git bash and run this command 
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com"" (put a valid email address)
Then generating key pair in two separate files in the project folder. e.g  project(private key file), project.pub (public key file)
Go to this location C:\Users\acer.vagrant.d and find file
insecure_private_key
Get backup of the file and copy the content of newly created private key and paste it in insecure_private_key file. Then copy insecure_private_key and paste it in this location too.
Now vagrant up in your project location. after generating above issue type vagrant ssh and go inside giving username, password. (in default username and password is set as vagrant)
Go inside to this location  cd /home/vagrant/.ssh and type mv authorized_keys authorized_keys_bk
Then type ls -al and type vi authorized_keys for open authorized_keys file vi editor.
Open generated public key from notepad++ (project.pub) and copy content
Then press i on git bash to enable insert mode on vi editor and right click and paste. After press escape to get out from insert mode
:wq! for save the file and type ls -al
Then permissions are set like bellow no need to change
  drwx------. 2 vagrant vagrant 4096 Feb 13 15:33 .
drwx------. 4 vagrant vagrant 4096 Feb 13 14:04 ..

-rw-------. 1 vagrant vagrant  409 Jan  2 23:09 authorized_keys_originial
Otherwise type chmod 600 authorized_keys and type this command too chown vagrant:vagrant authorized_keys
Finally run the vagrant halt and vagrant up again.

","This has happened to me several times and the way I solved it was :

Check and make sure your Vagrantfile has the correct private key path :
config.ssh.private_key_path = ""/home/razvan/.ssh/id_rsa""
Execute  > vagrant ssh command in a linux terminal
On your vagrant machine go to 
cd /home/vagrant/.ssh

and check if the ssh key in the authorized_keys file is the same as the one you have on your local machine in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. If not replace the one from your vagrant authorized_keys with the one on your local machine found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Reload Vagrant :
vagrant reload

","Just for those people that have been idiots like me, or have had something odd happen to their vagrant machine. This error can also occur when you changed the permissions of the vagrant user's home directory (deliberately or by accident).
You can log in instead (as described in other posts) using the password ('vagrant') and then run the following command to fix the permissions.
sudo chown -R vagrant:vagrant /home/vagrant
Then you should be able to log in again without entering the password.
TL;DR: The permissions on your vagrant home folder are wrong.

","In my experience, this has been a surprisingly frequent problem with new vagrant machines. By far the easiest way to solve it, instead of altering the configuration itself, has been creating the required ssh keys manually on the client, then using the private key on the host.

Log in to vagrant machine: vagrant ssh, use default password vagrant.
Create ssh keys: for example, ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""vagrant"" (as adviced by GitHub's relevant guide).
Rename the public key file (by default id_rsa.pub), overriding the old one: mv .ssh/id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys.
Reload ssh service in case needed: sudo service ssh reload.
Copy the private key file (by default id_rsa) to the host machine: for instance, use a fine combination of cat and clipboard, cat .ssh/id_rsa, paint and copy (better ways must exist, go invent one!).
Logout from the vagrant machine: logout.
Find the current private key used by vagrant by looking at its configuration: vagrant ssh-config (look for instance ÌdentityFile ""/[...]/private_key"".
Replace the current private key with the one you created at the host machine: for example, nano /[...]/private_key and paste from the clipboard, if all else fails. (Note, however, that if your private_key is not project specific but shared by multiple vagrant machines, you better configure the path yourself in order to not break other perfectly working machines! Changing the path is as simple as adding a line config.ssh.private_key_path = ""path/to/private_key"" into the Vagrantfile.) Furthermore, if you are using PuPHPet generated machine, you can store your private key to file puphpet/files/dot/ssh/id_rsa and it will be added to Vagrantfile's ssh config automatically.
Test the setup: vagrant ssh should now work.

Should that be the case, congratulate yourself, logout, run vagrant provision if needed and carry on with the meaningful task at hand.
If you still face problems, it may come handy to add verbose flag to ssh command to ease debugging. You can pass that (or any other option, for that matter) after double dash. For example, typing vagrant ssh -- -v. Feel free to add as many v's as you need, each will give you more information.

","I resolved the issue in the following manner.
1.  Create new SSH key using Git Bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""vagrant@localhost""
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
Generating public/private rsa key pair.


When you're prompted to ""Enter a file in which to save the key,"" press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/[you]/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. You can leave empty and press enter if you do not need a passphrase.
Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/[you]/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
To connect to your Vagrant VM type following command
ssh vagrant@localhost -p 2222

When you get following message type “yes” and press enter.
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.252.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?


Now to establish a SSH connection type : $ vagrant ssh
Copy the host public key into authorized_keys file in Vagrant VM. For that, go to “Users/[you]/.ssh” folder and copy the content in id_rsa.pub file in host machine and past into “~/.ssh/authorized_keys” file in Vagrant VM.
Change permission on SSH folder and authorized_keys file in Vagrant VM
Restart vagrant with : $ vagrant reload

In my case the problem came from my VirtualBox. I don't know for what reason an option was disabled and it should have been enabled.

As you can see in the image, there were some network problems with my VirtualBox and what I had to do in order to fix this problem was to select my machine, press on settings, network tab and after that make sure that the option Cable Connected was selected.

","Another simple solution, in windows, go to the file Homestead/Vagrantfile and add these lines to connect with a username/password instead of a private key:
config.ssh.username = ""vagrant""  
config.ssh.password = ""vagrant""  
config.ssh.insert_key = false 

So, finally part of the file will look like this :
if File.exists? homesteadYamlPath then
    settings = YAML::load(File.read(homesteadYamlPath))
elsif File.exists? homesteadJsonPath then
    settings = JSON.parse(File.read(homesteadJsonPath))
end

config.ssh.username = ""vagrant""  
config.ssh.password = ""vagrant""  
config.ssh.insert_key = false 

Homestead.configure(config, settings)

if File.exists? afterScriptPath then
    config.vm.provision ""shell"", path: afterScriptPath, privileged: false
end

It couldn't authenticate, retried again and again and eventually gave up.
**This is how I got it back in shape in 3 steps: **
1 - Find the IdentityFile used by vagrant:
$ vagrant ssh-config
Host default
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 2222
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /Users/ned/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL

2 - Check the public key in the IdentityFile:
$ ssh-keygen -y -f /Users/<user-name>/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
Replace '<user-name>' with your user.
It'll look something like this:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAA...9gE98OHlnVYCzRdK8jlqm8tehUc9c9WhQ==

3 - Log in to the vagrant machine with the password ""vagrant"":

How do you properly export a secret or private asc key to decrypt gpg files? 
","You can export the private key with the command-line tool from GPG. It works on the Windows-shell. Use the following command:
gpg --export-secret-keys

A normal export with --export will not include any private keys, therefore you have to use --export-secret-keys.
Edit:
To sum up the information given in my comments, this is the command that allows you to export a specific key with the ID 1234ABCD to the file secret.asc:
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor 1234ABCD > secret.asc

You can find the ID that you need using the following command. The ID is the second part of the second column:
gpg --list-keys

To Export just 1 specific secret key instead of all of them:
gpg --export-secret-keys keyIDNumber > exportedKeyFilename.asc

keyIDNumber is the number of the key id for the desired key you are trying to export.

","this ended up working for me:     
   gpg -a --export-secret-keys > exportedKeyFilename.asc 

you can name keyfilename.asc by any name as long as you keep on the .asc extension.
this command copies all secret-keys on a user's computer to keyfilename.asc in the working directory of where the command was called. 
To Export just 1 specific secret key instead of all of them:
   gpg -a --export-secret-keys keyIDNumber > exportedKeyFilename.asc

keyIDNumber is the number of the key id for the desired key you are trying to export.

which includes a reasonably secure way to transfer keys. You could put that recommendation into shell-scripts shown below for repeated use.
First get the KEYID you want from the list shown by
$ gpg -K

From the resulting list note the KEYID (the 8 hexadecimals following sec) you need for transfer.
Then envoke the tested shell scipts ""export_private_key"" on the first account and generate your pubkey.gpg + keys.asc. Subsequently invoke on the second account ""import_private_key"". Here is their content shown with cat (copy & paste content):
$ cat export_private_key 
gpg -K
echo ""select private key""
read KEYID
gpg --output pubkey.gpg --export $KEYID
echo REMEMBER THE COMING PASS-PHRASE
gpg --output - --export-secret-key $KEYID | \
   cat pubkey.gpg - | \
   gpg --armor --output keys.asc --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256
ls -l pubkey.gpg keys.asc
####################  E X P O R T _ P R I V A T E _ K E Y  #####################

Now tranfer by some means the ""pubkey.gpg"" (if needed) and the private ""keys.asc"" to the second account and envoke the below-shown program.
$ cat import_private_key 
gpg --no-use-agent --output - keys.asc | gpg --import

How do you properly export a secret or private asc key to decrypt gpg files? 
","1.Export a Secret Key (this is what your boss should have done for you)
gpg --export-secret-keys yourKeyName > privateKey.asc

2.Import Secret Key (import your privateKey)
gpg --import privateKey.asc

3.Not done yet, you still need to ultimately trust a key.
You will need to make sure that you also ultimately trust a key.
gpg --edit-key yourKeyName

Enter trust, 5, y, and then quit

the problem I have faced is that some pem files header begin with 
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

while others begin with

through my search I knew that the first ones are PKCS#8 formatted but I couldn't know what format does the other one belongs to.
","See https://polarssl.org/kb/cryptography/asn1-key-structures-in-der-and-pem (search the page for ""BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"") (archive link for posterity, just in case).
BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY is PKCS#1 and is just an RSA key. It is essentially just the key object from PKCS#8, but without the version or algorithm identifier in front. BEGIN PRIVATE KEY is PKCS#8 and indicates that the key type is included in the key data itself. From the link:

The unencrypted PKCS#8 encoded data starts and ends with the tags:
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
BASE64 ENCODED DATA
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

Within the base64 encoded data the following DER structure is present:
PrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
  version         Version,
  algorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier,
  PrivateKey      BIT STRING
}

AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
  algorithm       OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
  parameters      ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL
}

So for an RSA private key, the OID is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1 and there is a RSAPrivateKey as the PrivateKey key data bitstring.

As opposed to BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY, which always specifies an RSA key and therefore doesn't include a key type OID. BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY is PKCS#1:

RSA Private Key file (PKCS#1)
The RSA private key PEM file is specific for RSA keys.
It starts and ends with the tags:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
BASE64 ENCODED DATA
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Within the base64 encoded data the following DER structure is present:
RSAPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE {
  version           Version,
  modulus           INTEGER,  -- n
  publicExponent    INTEGER,  -- e
  privateExponent   INTEGER,  -- d
  prime1            INTEGER,  -- p

How can I get the private key and its certificate?
","It looks like you have a certificate in DER format instead of PEM.  This is why it works correctly when you provide the -inform PEM command line argument (which tells openssl what input format to expect).
It's likely that your private key is using the same encoding. It looks as if the openssl rsa command also accepts a -inform argument, so try:
openssl rsa -text -in file.key -inform DER

A PEM encoded file is a plain-text encoding that looks something like:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGrAgEAAiEA0tlSKz5Iauj6ud3helAf5GguXeLUeFFTgHrpC3b2O20CAwEAAQIh
ALeEtAIzebCkC+bO+rwNFVORb0bA9xN2n5dyTw/Ba285AhEA9FFDtx4VAxMVB2GU

8pL7M7DsTM7l3HXRAhAhIMYKQawc+Y7MNE4kQWYe
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

While DER is a binary encoding format.
Update
Sometimes keys are distributed in PKCS#8 format (which can be either PEM or DER encoded).  Try this and see what you get:
openssl pkcs8 -in file.key -inform der

How can I get the private key and its certificate?
","My two cents:
came across the same error message in RHEL7.3 while running the openssl command with root CA certificate. The reason being, while downloading the certificate from AD server, Encoding was selected as DER instead of Base64. Once the proper version of encoding was selected for the new certificate download, error was resolved 
Hope this helps for new users :-)

How can I get the private key and its certificate?
","I ran into the 'Expecting: ANY PRIVATE KEY' error when using openssl on Windows (Ubuntu Bash and Git Bash had the same issue).
The cause of the problem was that I'd saved the key and certificate files in Notepad using UTF8. Resaving both files in ANSI format solved the problem.

","If you have SSH installed, you should be able to run..
ssh-keygen

Then go through the steps, you'll have two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (the first is your private key, the second is your public key - the one you copy to remote machines)
Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys add the contents of your that id_rsa.pub file.
Oh, and chmod 600 all the id_rsa* files (both locally and remote), so no other users can read them:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*

Similarly, ensure the remote ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file is chmod 600 also:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Then, when you do ssh remote.machine, it should ask you for the key's password, not the remote machine.

To make it nicer to use, you can use ssh-agent to hold the decrypted keys in memory - this means you don't have to type your keypair's password every single time. To launch the agent, you run (including the back-tick quotes, which eval the output of the ssh-agent command)
`ssh-agent`

On some distros, ssh-agent is started automatically. If you run echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK and it shows a path (probably in /tmp/) it's already setup, so you can skip the previous command.
Then to add your key, you do
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

and enter your passphrase. It's stored until you remove it (using the ssh-add -D command, which removes all keys from the agent)

","Read the Obtaining your iPhone Distribution Certificate section of the Apple Developer Connection iPhone site. This explains step-by-step what you will need to do, in the correct order.
EDIT: The current link appears to be: https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH31-SW1

Before you can code sign your app, you create your development certificate and later, a distribution certificate to upload your app to iTunes Connect. You can create all the types of certificates and signing identities you need using Xcode. Xcode creates, downloads, and installs your signing identities for you.
All team members can create their own development certificate. Only a team agent or admin can create a distribution certificate. Only a team agent can create a Developer ID certificate. If you have an organization membership, read Managing Your Team in Member Center for a description of team roles and tasks that team agents perform on behalf of team members.
Xcode creates your development certificate for you when you need it. For example, when you assign your project to a team or create the team provisioning profile, as described in Configuring Identity and Team Settings, Xcode creates your development certificate and adds it to the team provisioning profile. Because of this, you typically create distribution certificates using the Xcode Preferences window.
To create a signing identity

In the Xcode Preferences window, click Accounts.
Select the team you want to use, and click View Details.
In the dialog that appears, click the Create button in the row of the type of certificate you want to create.
If the Create button is disabled, you are not allowed to create that type of signing identity. For a description of each type of certificate, refer to Table 14-2.
After the signing identity is created, the Create button disappears. 
To return to Accounts preferences, click Done.

","As no one has updated or answered this question since Nathan pointed out the original answer link is unavailable (Point number one on posting on stackoverflow ""Please be sure to answer the question"") here is an answer from my experiance, hope it helps someone:
For this specific question (Dev/Distribution cert installed but no private key) the answer is a choice of 2 alternatives:
1. Create a new certificate identity via the apple devloper portal
In this case you'll need to log into the apple developer portal and use the assistant, as part of this you will need to create and upload a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) which will also create the public and private keys on the machine. Apple sign the request and voila, a signed public/private certificate pair : Reference
2. Export the private key from the machine originally used to create the Certificate
This case is when your signing with an identity previously created, probably on an old machine or if (as in my case) your developing for a client that has their ID's already created. If you can't access the machine originally used to create the certificate identity you'll have to create a new identity as per the guide/assistant.
To do this, you will need to export your private key (a .p12 file), or public/private key pair via Keychain Access, and install the private key or key pair to the machine your developing on. Here's a guide I found on stackoverflow.
Ref: http://iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/11498-problems-exporting-importing-p12-private-key-for-developing-on-another-mac.html
PS> Be warned, I am performing the latter option right now, and while evidence suggests this will work, it is untested by me as of yet, If if doesn't work I will re-reply!

","I had the same problem. You need to define your JAVA_HOME environment variable.
Read the ""Basic Setup for signing"" paragraph of this link : http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html#setup
It says:

Before you begin, make sure that the Keytool utility and Jarsigner utility are available to the SDK build tools. Both of these tools are available in the JDK. In most cases, you can tell the SDK build tools how to find these utilities by setting your JAVA_HOME environment variable so it references a suitable JDK. Alternatively, you can add the JDK version of Keytool and Jarsigner to your PATH variable.
If you are developing on a version of Linux that originally came with GNU Compiler for Java, make sure that the system is using the JDK version of Keytool, rather than the gcj version. If Keytool is already in your PATH, it might be pointing to a symlink at /usr/bin/keytool. In this case, check the symlink target to be sure it points to the Keytool in the JDK.

","Fixing the problem on win7 (yuk) without Eclipse:
i have the environment variable JAVA_HOME set to ..../JDK1.7.0_03 (android programmed from GLbasic), and i did only 2 things to fix the problem:
1) in the folder ..../Java/JDK1.7.0_03 i removed the ""read-only"" permission of the /bin sub-folder, which contains keytool.exe.
2) i opened the console ""as administrator"" (although it's the only account on my win7).
then you do cd...JDK / bin, run again keytool.exe, and you get the file nickname.keystore auto-generated in JDK / bin.
Once everything is done you could re-assign the ""read-only"" permission.
Good luck!

I understand that a sender may add a digital signature to a document using his/her private key to essentially obtain a hash of the document, but what I do not understand is how the public key can be used to verify that signature. 
My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","Your understanding of ""public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt"" is correct...  for data/message ENCRYPTION.  For digital signatures, it is the reverse.  With a digital signature, you are trying to prove that the document signed by you came from you.  To do that, you need to use something that only YOU have:  your private key.
A digital signature in its simplest description is a hash (SHA1, MD5, etc.) of the data (file, message, etc.) that is subsequently encrypted with the signer's private key.  Since that is something only the signer has (or should have) that is where the trust comes from.  EVERYONE has (or should have) access to the signer's public key.   
So, to validate a digital signature, the recipient 

Calculates a hash of the same data (file, message, etc.),
Decrypts the digital signature using the sender's PUBLIC key, and 
Compares the 2 hash values.    

If they match, the signature is considered valid.  If they don't match, it either means that a different key was used to sign it, or that the data has been altered (either intentionally or unintentionally).
Hope that helps!

My understanding was that public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt... can anyone help me understand? 
","Thought I'd provide a supplemental explanation for anyone looking for something more intuitively revealing.
A big part of this confusion arises from naming 'public keys' and 'private keys' as such because how these things actually work is directly at odds with how a 'key' is understood to be.
Take encryption for example. It could be thought of as working like so:

The parties that want to be able to read the secret messages each keep a key
hidden (i.e. a private key)
The parties that want to be able to send secret messages all have the ability to obtain an unlocked locked (i.e. a public lock)
Then sending a secret message is as easy as locking it with an unlocked lock, but unlocking it afterwards can only be done with one of the hidden keys.

This allows secret messages to be sent between parties, but from an intuitive standpoint here, 'public lock' is a more suitable name than 'public key'.
However, for sending digital signatures the roles are somewhat reversed:

The party that wants to sign messages is the only one with access to the unlocked locks (i.e. a private lock)
The parties that want to verify the signature all have the ability to obtain a key (i.e. a public key)
Then what the signer does is create two identical messages: the one that anyone can read and one to accompany it, but which they lock with one of their private locks.
Then when the receiver gets the message, they can read it, and then use the public key to unlock the locked message and compare the two messages. If the messages are the same, then they know that:

The unlocked message wasn't tampered with during travel and,
The message must have been from the person who has the matching lock to their public key.

And finally, this entire system only works if anyone who wants to validate a signer's signature has an authoritative place to go to to get the matching key to the signer's locks. Otherwise, anyone can say ""Hey, here's the key to so-and-so's private lock"", send you a message pretending to be them but lock it with their private lock, you perform all the above steps and believe the message must actually be from the person you thought, but you're fooled because you were mislead as to the true owner of a public key.

So long as there's a trust-worthy source for retrieving a signer's public key, you'll know who the rightful owner of a public key is, and will be able to validate their signature.

","The public key encrypts and only the private key can decrypt it, and the reverse is true. They both encrypt to different hashes but each key can decrypt the other's encryption. 
There are a few different ways to verify that a message came from some expected sender. For example:
The sender sends:

The message
The hash of the message encrypted with their private key

The receiver:

Decrypts the signature (2) with the public key to obtain a message, supposedly the same message as (1) but we don't know yet. We now have two messages that we need to verify are identical. So to do this, we will encrypt them both with our public key and compare the two hashes. So we will ....
Encrypt the original message (1) with the public key to obtain a hash
Encrypt the decrypted message (3) to get a second hash and compare to (4) to verify that they are identical. 

If they aren't identical it means either the message was tampered with or it was signed with some other key and not the one we thought...
Another example would be for the sender to use a common hash that the receiver might know to use as well. For example:
The sender sends:

A message 
Takes a known hash of the message, then encrypts the hash with the private key

The receiver:

Decrypts (2) and gets a hash value
Hashes the message (1) with the same hash used by the sender
Compares the two hashes to make sure they match

This again ensures the message wasn't tampered with and it is from the expected sender.

","This could be caused by not having the private key associated with your certificate in your keychain. You can verify this by going to Keychain Access and choosing ""Certificates"" from the ""Category"" area at the bottom left. If your developer certificate does not appear when filtering that way, you are missing the private key for it. 
If this is the case, you'll have to add your private key to the keychain, or else just reject and re-issue your development certificate with a new private key (you can find steps for this in the provisioning portal.)

","For certificate to be valid it needs to be associated in your Keychain with a private key. Find the ""iPhone Developer..."" certificate in your Keychain and see if it's got a private key associated with it. 
This can occur when you develop on two or more computers. You need to export the certificate+private key pair from the computer where you generated the private key first. Then import it onto all computers you do development on. 
See Apple's Transferring Your Identities for more detailed info.

","Apple has a great article regarding Certificates and Provisioning-Profiles,
with excellent troubleshooting:  
iOS Code Signing Troubleshooting
The most useful part I found was regarding cleanup of old provisioning-profiles from Xcode:  
""Keep Your Profile Library Clean
...You need to manually remove provisioning profiles you are not using,
otherwise, Xcode will reimport potentially old or duplicate certificates into the keychain
and that can cause build errors.""
And as a weapon of last resort, you can use this procedure:

","The question is a bit old now, and nginx actually supports passphrase asking at startup since at least version 1.2. But the issue is still relevant because this capability has been removed from debian in the latest release, version 8 with nginx 1.6. The reason is that passphrase input hasn't been implemented in the systemd script for nginx, while it has been for apache. Launching nginx manually simply works, and it's not too a problem since manual intervention is required anyway, there's no use of systemd here.

Press Save private key to save the private key in .ppk format;

Or even easier, use the PuTTYgen to create the a key directly in the PuTTY format, instead of using the ssh-keygen.

I guess I should do something similar with the public key as done with the private key in lines 2 and 3. Because the certificate is also encrypted. Any suggestions?
","To test your scenario, I've created an RSA private key with openssl.
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 1024

Then I've converted this key to PKCS#8 DER format.
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in private.pem -outform DER -out private.der -nocrypt

The manual of openssl refers to PKCS#8 and DER both as formats, so as far as I'm concerned the following happens:

pkcs8 tells openssl that I want to work with private keys in PKCS#8 format.
-topk8 tells it that the private key I'm going to specify with -in is not in PKCS#8 (otherwise it'll assume it is).
-inform and -in specify that I want to convert the (PEM) private key to PKCS#8 (without -topk8 it'll try to convert a key already in PKCS#8 format to a standard key format).
-outform and -out tells it I want a DER formatted key as output.
-nocrypt tells it that I don't want to encrypt the key.

Then, with my RSA key (in standard format) I've created a certificate.
openssl req -new -x509 -keyform PEM -key private.pem -outform DER -out public.der

The certificate contains the public key corresponding to my private key.
After all of these, I've encoded both the private key and the certificate with Base64.
base64 private.der > private.der.b64
base64 public.der > public.der.b64

The following files were generated.
private.pem      # standard
private.der      # pkcs8/DER
private.der.b64 
public.der       # x509/DER
public.der.b64   

public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, GeneralSecurityException {
  // get a handle on the base64 encoded key and certificate
  File privateKeyFile = new File(""private.der.b64"");
  File publicKeyFile = new File(""public.der.b64"");

  // pull them into arrays
  byte[] privateKeyBytes = toByteArray(privateKeyFile);
  byte[] publicKeyBytes = toByteArray(publicKeyFile);

  // decode them
  privateKeyBytes = toDecodedBase64ByteArray(privateKeyBytes);
  publicKeyBytes = toDecodedBase64ByteArray(publicKeyBytes);

  // get the private key
  KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
  KeySpec privateKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privateKeyBytes);
  PrivateKey privateKey = keyFactory.generatePrivate(privateKeySpec);

  // get the public key
  CertificateFactory certificateFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X509"");
  Certificate certificate = certificateFactory.generateCertificate(new ByteArrayInputStream(publicKeyBytes));
  PublicKey publicKey = certificate.getPublicKey();
}

private static byte[] toByteArray(File file) throws IOException {
  // java 7's try-with-resources statement
  try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(file);
      FileChannel channel = in.getChannel()) {
    ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    channel.transferTo(0, channel.size(), Channels.newChannel(out));
    return out.toByteArray();

private static byte[] toDecodedBase64ByteArray(byte[] base64EncodedByteArray) {
  return DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(
      new String(base64EncodedByteArray, Charset.forName(""UTF-8"")));
}

The main problem was that you had a certificate instead of a public key. The certificate contains the public key, but it cannot be loaded with X509EncodedKeySpec(...), this is why the CertificateFactory has to be used instead.
(By the way here is a great article/tutorial on openssl and Java cryptography usage. I've got my info partly from there.)

    ServerSQLManager s = new ServerSQLManager();
    ServerUser user = new ServerUser(""testUser"", ""pass123"");

    PublicKey testKey = user.getPublicKey();
    System.out.println(testKey);
    PrivateKey testKey2 = user.getPrivateKey();
    System.out.println(testKey2);

When I run this, I get an inappropriate key specification, can anyone point me in the right direction with this? The console output is:

I'm aware I shouldn't be using the sun.misc.* library, and we're looking into the Apache version, but would still like to figure this out (also it will never be production code)
Any advice appreciated.
","Public keys are stored using a X509EncodedKeySpec as you have, but Private keys use the PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. For example like this:

    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(clear);
    KeyFactory fact = KeyFactory.getInstance(""DSA"");

    Arrays.fill(clear, (byte) 0);
    return priv;

public static PublicKey loadPublicKey(String stored) throws GeneralSecurityException {

","I know it's a little bit late but I also have been looking for a way to do this and while i was searching I found your question, now that I have found a way to do this I decided to come back and share this:
// generate key pair

KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
keyPairGenerator.initialize(1024);
KeyPair keyPair = keyPairGenerator.genKeyPair();

// extract the encoded private key, this is an unencrypted PKCS#8 private key
byte[] encodedprivkey = keyPair.getPrivate().getEncoded();

// We must use a PasswordBasedEncryption algorithm in order to encrypt the private key, you may use any common algorithm supported by openssl, you can check them in the openssl documentation http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/pkcs8.html
String MYPBEALG = ""PBEWithSHA1AndDESede"";
String password = ""pleaseChangeit!"";

int count = 20;// hash iteration count
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
byte[] salt = new byte[8];
random.nextBytes(salt);

// Create PBE parameter set
PBEParameterSpec pbeParamSpec = new PBEParameterSpec(salt, count);
PBEKeySpec pbeKeySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray());
SecretKeyFactory keyFac = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(MYPBEALG);
SecretKey pbeKey = keyFac.generateSecret(pbeKeySpec);

Cipher pbeCipher = Cipher.getInstance(MYPBEALG);

// Initialize PBE Cipher with key and parameters
pbeCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, pbeKey, pbeParamSpec);

// Encrypt the encoded Private Key with the PBE key
byte[] ciphertext = pbeCipher.doFinal(encodedprivkey);

// Now construct  PKCS #8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo object
AlgorithmParameters algparms = AlgorithmParameters.getInstance(MYPBEALG);
algparms.init(pbeParamSpec);
EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo encinfo = new EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo(algparms, ciphertext);

// and here we have it! a DER encoded PKCS#8 encrypted key!
byte[] encryptedPkcs8 = encinfo.getEncoded();

This example code is based on the folowing code I found: http://www.jensign.com/JavaScience/PEM/EncPrivKeyInfo/EncPrivKeyInfo.java

Edit:
I solved the first command :
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out privkey.pem 2048

But now I'm getting an error with the second:
unknown option –x509

","'genrsa' generates just an RSA key.
'req' then uses that key to make a x509 style request.
If you just need a rsa key pair - use genrsa.
If you need a keypair and a signed x509 request you use 'genrsa' and then 'req'.
Optionally 'req' can also generate that key for you (i.e. it encapsulates the 'genrsa' command (and the gendh). 
So:
 openssl genrsa -aes128 -out privkey.pem 2048
 openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem 

is almost equivalent to
 openssl req -new -x509 -keyout privkey.pem  -newkey rsa:2048

except that unlike 'genrsa', 'req' does not allow you to specify aes128 as the encryption.
So in a lot of enterprise settings one does it in two steps as to get sufficient control over the key encryption applied.

","Maybe your problem is with permissions for your key. I know in linux its required to change the permissions. 
Taken from the website http://om4.com.au/ssh-rsa-key-pairs-passphrases-leopard/

Clear the contents of your ~/.ssh directory and set the directory permissions to 700 (directories need to be ""executable"")
$ rm ~/.ssh/*
$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Generate your rsa key pair (there are variations for this, but this is the version I used):
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Set the permissions for all files in ~/.ssh to 600
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh
Copy your id_rsa.pub key to your server’s .ssh/authorized_keys file
Add your passphrase to your keychain using this command:

","The error Enter your password for the SSH key x can result from using a key of the wrong format (such as a ppk key) in ssh or sftp. This is because it is interpreted as an encrypted ssh key and so prompts for the passphrase, when actually there is no passphrase.

","The example amazon provided is correct. It sounds like a folder permissions issue. If you created the folder you are trying to copy to with another user or another user created it, chances are you don't have permissions to copy to it or edit it. 
If you have sudo abilities, you can try opening access for yourself. Though not recommended to be left this way, you could try this command:
sudo chmod 777 /folderlocation

That gives complete read/write/executable permissions to anyone (hence why you shouldn't leave it at 777) but it will give you the chance to test your scp command to rule out permissions. 
Afterwards if you aren't familiar with permissions, I suggest you read up on it. this is an example: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/filepermissions.html It is generally suggested you lock down the folder as much as possible depending on the type of information held within. 
If that was not the cause some other things you might want to check:

are you in the directory of your key when executing the 'scp -i keyname' command?
do you have permissions to use the folder you are transferring from?

Best of luck.

any idea what is wrong? I tried this on OpenSSL openssl pkcs8 -inform DER -in aaa010101aaa_FIEL.key -out aaa010101aaa_FIEL_key.pem and it works but when I want to read the key in DER format it just sends that exception.
","Well finally looking at this thread Encrypting with RSA private key in Java found the answer.
First I had to unprotect the key, as follows
openssl pkcs8 -inform DER -in myDERPassProtectedPrivate.key -outform PEM -out myPEMPrivate.key
it asked me for my password and then I had the file myPEMPrivate.key Once done this proceed to get rid of the password protecting the key like follows
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in myPEMPrivate.key -outform DER -out myNotAnyMoreProtectedPrivate.key
with this I'm now able to load the key with the code above. If we want to have a pass-protected key in java it is highly advisable to use a keystore.
P.S. I tried to avoid the 2 steps to get rid of the password protecting the key with openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -inform der -in myDERPassProtectedPrivate.key -outform der -out myDERNoPassProtectedPrivate.key but I don't know why I had the error Error decrypting key I used WinOpenSSL maybe that's the reason why I got that error.

I have installed OpenSSL on Windows and tried to get a random key using 

I have the CRT file but I'm unsure how to get keys from it. Inside the CRT file it shows -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----. 
","In the image, note the OpenSSL> prompt. It means you're inside openssl command and you don't need to type ""openssl"" again (that's why you've got the message ""openssl is an invalid command""). In this case, you should just type genrsa etc...
But I don't know if I get what you're trying to do (generate a key from a crt file), mainly because: genrsa is a command to generate a new key pair using RSA algorithm. In short, it generates 2 keys: one private and one public. The public key will be signed by a Certification Authority, and the result is a digital certificate (which can be in a CRT file)
My point is: if you have a CRT file (aka certificate), it means a key pair was already generated and signed by a Certification Authority. There's no way to generate a new key from it (because it already has a key).
If you want to get the public key that's inside the certificate, you must read it using openssl x509 command. Something like openssl x509 -text -in crtfile (or omit ""openssl"" if you're inside OpenSSL> prompt).
PS: this command prints the whole certificate. If you want just the public key, you can run x509 -pubkey -noout -in crtfile
If you want to generate a new key pair, then use genrsa.

","It seems, there is no straight-forward way to do this in .NET. Therefore I've decided now to load the certificate directly from the certificate store:
X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
store.Open(OpenFlags.OpenExistingOnly | OpenFlags.ReadOnly);
X509Certificate2Collection certificates = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, CERTIFICATE_THUMB_PRINT, false);
if (certificates.Count == 0)
{
    // ""Certificate not installed.""
}
else
{
    certificate = certificates[0];
}
store.Close();

For that, of course, if has to be installed on the machine.
I think this is a nice solution to this problem, because it adds an additional layer of security to it (the app must be run on the machine, on which the certificate is installed and as the user who installed it, also the file itself can be stored in a safe place somewhere else).

","Perhaps you can tell us a bit more about why you want to do this. There certainly are good reasons to want to do this, such as writing a program that would sit on your company's internal server to automate product builds.
But if you intend to distribute this application outside of a high trust zone (e.g. to customers) then the answer is DO NOT DO IT! You should never give out your private key file. That opens it up to brute force attack of your password, (which is certainly much weaker than the private key itself). And if you distribute your application, then your password is included in plain text in the MSIL code. There it can be easily viewed using any managed code disassembler (e.g. Reflector) , and it can probably even be viewed with a text or hex editor.
In summary, distributing your private key file along with your application to someone allows them to easily sign anything they want with YOUR cert. The whole point of a private key is to keep it safely locked away in a location where it can never be accessed by anyone but you (or your organization, etc).

cert.PrivateKey; // Works on my machine (only)

This works perfectly fine (on my machine), but when I run the same code on another machine, it throws: ""Key set not found"", even though HasPrivateKey returns true! Shouldn't the private key be included in the *.pfx-file? Can you tell me:

Was the certificate/private key somehow automatically installed on my machine by openssl when I created it?
How can I read the private key from the *.PFX-file (or alternatively from the *.PEM-file)?

THINGS TO CONSIDER:

","I finally cracked down the problem, but couldn't post the answer until now (because I'm a beginer):
The thing is that I was importing the .p12 the wrong way. I was double clicking it and following the steps. What this did was to put the certificate in the Current User - Personal certificate store, so I thought that by just moving the cert from that store to the Local Machine store was enough... but oh surprise! it was not.
After much revision, I found that the IIS has the capability of importing certificates from within itself, and that this puts the certificate directly in the Local Machine cert store.
If anyone has the some problem or just wants to see how to do this, these are the steps:

Open the IIS.
Go to the Server Certificates (sorry if you don't find the exact words, my Windows is in Spanish)
Select Import
Select your file. If your file is a .p12 like mine, then select to view *.*
Type in the password
Accept... and voilá

","I am not certain if this is exactly what you are looking for, but the OPEN MASTER KEY remarks had something that seemed relevant.
You will 100% want to test this not in production, but it seems that once the master key has been opened, you have the option to not require that with the ALTER MASTER KEY REGENERATE command.

If the database master key was encrypted with the service master key,
  it will be automatically opened when it is needed for decryption or
  encryption. In this case, it is not necessary to use the OPEN MASTER
  KEY statement. 
When a database is first attached or restored to a
  new instance of SQL Server, a copy of the database master key
  (encrypted by the service master key) is not yet stored in the server.
You must use the OPEN MASTER KEY statement to decrypt the database
  master key (DMK). Once the DMK has been decrypted, you have the option
  of enabling automatic decryption in the future by using the ALTER
  MASTER KEY REGENERATE statement to provision the server with a copy of
  the DMK, encrypted with the service master key (SMK). 
When a database has been upgraded from an earlier version, the DMK should be
  regenerated to use the newer AES algorithm. For more information about
  regenerating the DMK, see ALTER MASTER KEY (Transact-SQL). The time
  required to regenerate the DMK key to upgrade to AES depends upon the
  number of objects protected by the DMK. Regenerating the DMK key to
  upgrade to AES is only necessary once, and has no impact on future
  regenerations as part of a key rotation strategy.

This paragraph gave it away:

The copy of the DMK stored in the master system database is silently updated whenever the DMK is changed. However, this default can be changed by using the DROP ENCRYPTION BY SERVICE MASTER KEY option of the ALTER MASTER KEY statement. A DMK that is not encrypted by the service master key must be opened by using the OPEN MASTER KEY statement and a password.

Ran the following on my secondary nodes. 

Drop Certificate...
Drop master key
Create master key...
Create certificate from file...

Arrived at the solution after checking this.
--on primary, output: master 
select name from sys.databases where is_master_key_encrypted_by_server=1

--on secondary, output: nothing...
select name from sys.databases where is_master_key_encrypted_by_server=1

So I figured if I could get the master key to be encrypted by default by the service master key then this would automate the decryption.
--on secondary
drop certificate [BackupCertWithPK]
drop master key

--Skipped restore master key from file.
--Instead, I ran create master key with password.
create master key encryption by password = 'MyTest!Mast3rP4ss';

--verify by open/close.
open master key decryption by password = 'MyTest!Mast3rP4ss';
close master key;

--proceed to restore/create cert from file.
create cerfiticate [BackupCertWithPK] 
from file = '\\FS1\SqlBackups\SQL1\Donot_delete_SQL1-Primary_BackupCertWithPK.cer' 
with private key (file = '\\FS1\SqlBackups\SQL1\Donot_delete_SQL1-Primary_BackupCertWithPK.key' , decryption by password = 'key_Test!prim@ryP4ss') ; 

After this ran the above select again.
--on secondary, output: master, now there was hope again!
select name from sys.databases where is_master_key_encrypted_by_server=1

Finally, I re-ran my backup job with options set for Verify and Encryption successfully. Verify step did not fail nor prompted to open/close the master key.
The following simply worked as intended without needing to open/close the master key.
RESTORE VERIFYONLY FROM DISK = '\\FS1\SqlBackups\SQL01\SystemDbs\msdb_backup_2017_09_22_171915_6346240.bak' WITH FILE = 1, NOUNLOAD, NOREWIND;

","You can persist your RSA public/private key using SharedPreference on android. 
In order to keep your keys safe when the phone is maliciously rooted, you can do the following steps:
1: When you want to ecrypt any data generate a key pair.
2: Prompt the user for a password.
3: Use that password to generate a symmetric key to encrypt your private key.
4: You can encrypt your data using the public key and decrypt using private key.
5: You can keep a session for the password prompted in step 2. During that session, you can use the symmetric key(generated from password) to encrypt/decrypt the private key.

The first error code -25300 represents errSecItemNotFound. So there is no value stored for this key. Then, when I try to add the private key into the Keychain I get -25299 which means  errSecDuplicateItem. I do not understand this. Why is this happening?
Does anyone have a clue or hint on this?

Update #1: I've figured out that it works only for the first time. Even when data and key is different, after the first time stored into the keychain I cannot store further keys.
","Sorry but I'll never be able to debug your code. Apple provides some sample code (KeychainItemWrapper) which lets you save one string (I recall). Its a big help dealing with the key chain. There is a gist on the web that is a modified version of that class, but saves and restores a dictionary (archived as a data object, which is what the Apple code does to the string). This lets you save multiple items in one interface to the keychain. The gist is here Keychain for NSDictionary/data

Instead it is simplier to:
Change the ""server.key"" link Permissions in PostgreSQL Data Directory (its the Location where the Link to the private certificate.key File resides)
# cd /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/
to
# chown -R postgres:postgres server.key`

And make sure that the original Certificate in
# /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

has those Properties, by Setting them 
# chmod 640 ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
# chown root:ssl-cert ssl-cert-snakeoil.key

This Solution has been tested on Debian. 
Please remember that CentOS can use the SELinux with extended User Rights Management, which can be viewed by 
# ls -laZ *

The key then looks like:
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
XXX...

My Python code looks like:
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
# ...
f = open('private-key.pem', 'r')
r = RSA.importKey(f.read(),  passphrase='some-pass')
f.close()

but I am getting an exception:

ValueError: RSA key format is not supported

What's wrong?
Is it possible to generate an encrypted RSA key, store it in a file and later use it with PyCrypto? Is it possible to do it with OpenSSL? What formats are supported?
Importing the public key works fine, however it is not encrypted.
","Hypothesis #1
After looking to the source code, I think, I solved the mystery. The way how import works for PEM keys encrypted with a password is that the PEM gets decrypted to DER and after that importKeyDER function is called. If provided password is not correct, the format of generated DER representation will not be correct too and you would get an exception that you've provided. To confirm that, I ran two quick tests below:
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> f = open('<some-path>/private-key.pem','r')
>>> r=RSA.importKey(f.read(),passphrase='foo')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 665, in importKey
    return self._importKeyDER(der)
  File ""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Crypto/PublicKey/RSA.py"", line 588, in    _importKeyDER
    raise ValueError(""RSA key format is not supported"")
ValueError: RSA key format is not supported
>>> f = open('<some-path>/private-key.pem','r')
>>> r=RSA.importKey(f.read(),passphrase='<valid-pass-phrase>')
>>> r
<_RSAobj @0xb7237b2c n(4096),e,d,p,q,u,private>

After receiving the PEM from the author, I've realized that Hypothesis #1 is not valid for his case. I still want to keep it here as one possible reason of import failure, so other users are aware.
Hypothesis #2 - this is the author's case.
RSA.py looks for the following in PEM file to determine what kind of encryption was applied to PEM:
 Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED

When key is generated using ""openssl genrsa ..."" command, this string is present in PEM in clear, however when ""opensl genpkey ..."" is used the ""Proc-Type"" is not present.
RSA.py doesn't even try to decrypt the PEM if the ""Proc-Type"" is not found:
  # The encrypted PEM format
  if lines[1].startswith(b('Proc-Type:4,ENCRYPTED')):
     DEK = lines[2].split(b(':'))
     ....

So, my conclusion at this time is that keys generated by ""openssl genpkey"" are not supported by PyCrypto v 2.6.1.
Important Update
It does work in PyCrypto's latest version 2.7a1. You can download it from here: http://ftp.dlitz.net/pub/dlitz/crypto/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.7a1.tar.gz

","A quick update for those who seek to solve this problem without installing an experimental release of long-abandoned PyCrypto. The library can be safely replaced by pycryptodome (https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome) - it can provide both a drop-in replacement for pycrypto, and it can be used as an alternative library as well (pycryptodomex).

Why trusted root store and not personal?
  I have a pre-built assembly that accesses this certificate in this particular store, so simply placing the certificate in Personal store won't do the trick for me. That's why setting trust permissions on private keys of trusted root certificates is imperative.

","Solution
It is possible to set trust permissions on certificates other than those in Personal certificate store, but you can't set permissions via MMC. At least not directly on the store that is. Accepted answer shows a simplified approach with moving certificates around to achieve the same result.
You have to do it this way...
Getting the tool

Get WF_WCF_Samples file from Microsoft. This is a self extracting archive, but you won't need to extract everything. So...
Open the file with any archiver tool and only extract FindPrivateKey solution/project
Open in Visual Studio and compile it.

Finding your private key

Open MMC and add Certificates snap-in. Make sure you select Computer and Local Machine when adding it.
Select the store that has your certificate with private key.
Open private key and copy its Thumbprint
Open command prompt and navigate to the folder where you compiled your FindPrivateKey tool
Enter this command

FindPrivateKey YourStoreName LocalMachine -t ""ThumbprintWithSpaces"" -a
  ie.
  FindPrivateKey Root LocalMachine -t ""83 45 22 ..."" -a

Copy file along with path (it will liekly span over two lines so copy to Notepad and concatenate)

Grant certificate trust

open command prompt and enter:

icacls ""FullPathOfYourPrivateKey"" /grant:r ""UserFQDN"":f
  ie.
  icacls ""c:\ProgramData..."" /grant:r ""IIS AppPool\ASP.NET v4.0"":f

Done.

This will grant certificate private key full trust to your user (in my case above it's application pool identity) so you can use the key to sign data or do whatever you need to do with it.
In case you don't want full permissions, you can easily change the last part after colon. It can have many different settings, so I urge you to check icacls command help.

","I haven't tried this with the Trusted Root Certification Authorities but what I have found is the simplest thing to do with other Certificate Stores is to drag and drop the certificate into the Personal Store and then set permissions and then drag and drop back to the original certificate store. In your case the Trusted Root Certification Authorities.
Steps using Certificates MMC:

Import certificate to the store you want it and mark keys as exportable. (You might be able to bypass this and import directly to the Personal Store, but I haven't tried.)
Drag and drop the imported cert to the Personal Store.
Right click the certificate in the Personal Store and in the context menu, click ""All Tasks"", then in the submenu click on ""Manage Private Keys"". Set the appropriate permissions according to your app pool as referenced in step 1.
After permissions have been set, drag and drop the certificate back to the original store (in your case the Trusted Root Certification Authorities).

","If you are using Windows Server 2003, you'll notice that you don't get the Manage Private Keys task under your certificate.
If you install Microsoft WSE 2.0 on to your machine, you can use a tool called X509 Certificate Tool.  Just search for your cert, its more than likely in (or should be) in Local Machine / Personal Store.
NOTE: if you have your cert in Current User / Personal Store (which often is the default), it will only be accessible to the user that is currently logged in, which means if you want your webserver to access it, it can't without changing permissions to your AppPool.
You should be able to change the permissions to the private key very easily, by default, your AppPool on your webserver will be using NETWORK SERVICE to run your web application.  So just add NETWORK SERVICE to the security and by default it will set the Read and Read / Execute permissions which is sufficient for your BouncyCastle, etc, to read the private key so you can sign your document.
Hope this helps.

"4422633","RSA: Private key calculation with Extended Euclidean Algorithm","I'm a high school student writing a paper on RSA, and I'm doing an example with some very small prime numbers. I understand how the system works, but I can't for the life of me calculate the private key using the extended euclidean algorithm.
Here's what I have done so far:

I have chosen the prime numbers p=37
and q=89 and calculated N=3293
I have calculated (p-1)(q-1)=3168
I have chosen a number e so that e and 3168 are relatively prime. I'm checking this with the standard euclidean algorithm, and that works very well. My e=25

Now I just have to calculate the private key d, which should satisfy ed=1 (mod 3168)
Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find d such that de+tN=1 I get -887•25+7•3168=1. I throw the 7 away and get d=-887. Trying to decrypt a message, however, this doesn't work.
I know from my book that d should be 2281, and it works, but I can't figure out how they arrive at that number.
Can anyone help? I've tried solving this problem for the last 4 hours, and have looked for an answer everywhere. I'm doing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm by hand, but since the result works my calculations should be right.
Thanks in advance,
Mads
","You're so close you're going to kick yourself.
3168-887=2281.
Specifically, If you have a mod x, then A must satisfy 0<=a<x. If it doesn't, add or subtract x as many times as necessary until you are in this range. This is called modular arithmetic.
You might want to read up on linear congruences and number theory. These topics are degree level mathematics in the UK (what you'd call college I guess) so don't worry if it seems a bit odd. A linear congruence simply says that -887 mod 3168 and 2281 mod 3168 are actually the same thing because they are part of the same class, the class that turns out as 2281 mod 3168 in the required range. 2281+3168 mod 3168 would also be in that class.
Have fun!

X509DecryptString(token, @""c:\CA.cer"", ""mypassword"");

And passing the pvk file (.pvk)

","The certificate itself only contains the public key (+ some data), but not the private key. (It's very unlikely that the RSA private key is ""mypassword"". The password that protects your private key may be ""mypassword"", but the private key itself (more specifically the private exponent, in RSA) will be a rather long number.)
As a result (because CA.cer only contains the certificate), X509DecryptString(token, @""c:\CA.cer"", ""mypassword"") will almost certainly not work.
X509DecryptString(token, @""c:\CA.pvk"", ""mypassword""); could work in principle, but you're creating a X509Certificate2 object from it, and it still needs the certificate and the private key. You should be able to load that from a PKCS#12 container (.p12/.pfx).
To create this container, you can use pvk2pfx:
pvk2pfx -spc CA.cer -pvk CA.pvk -pfx CA.pfx

(If you don't specify -pfx CA.pfx, it will launch the interactive interface, in which case you need to tick the box to export the private key.)
Then, try to decrypt using that pfx/p12 file instead.

export $name=""$(awk 'BEGIN{}{out=out$0""\n""}END{print out}' $file| sed 's/\n$//')""

","export the key
export PRIVATE_KEY=`cat ./gitbu.2018-03-23.private-key.pem`

echo $PRIVATE_KEY;

If you want to save the key to a .env file with the rest of your environment variables, all you needed to do is ""wrap"" the private key string in single quotes in the .env file ... e.g: sh exports HELLO_WORLD='-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA04up8hoqzS1+APIB0RhjXyObwHQnOzhAk5Bd7mhkSbPkyhP1 ... iWlX9HNavcydATJc1f0DpzF0u4zY8PY24RVoW8vk+bJANPp1o2IAkeajCaF3w9nf q/SyqAWVmvwYuIhDiHDaV2A== -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----'
So the following command will work:
echo ""export PRIVATE_KEY='`cat ./gitbu.2018-03-23.private-key.pem`'"" >> .env

","What I wanted is one and only one executable shell script containing it all, and not 1 script and 1 .pem file and then doing some gymnastics in between, like what I am seeing in the existing answers so far. 
To achieve this unification, all that is needed is the following. Preparation phase:
cat id_rsa | base64 -w0
# assign the converted 1-liner string wrap in single quote into a shell variable, for example
pk='xxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyzzzzzzzzzzz......'

The rest is walk-in-the park. To ssh using variable pk you will convert back the 1-liner string into its original posture and write to a temporary file.  
t=$(mktemp)
printf $pk | base64 --decode > $t
ssh -i $t smeagol@192.143.69.69

To clean-up, use the trap:
trap cleanup 1 2 3 6
cleanup () {
    rm -f $t
}

To improve security, modify mktemp so write somewhere within your $HOME folder where only you can read, rather than in /tmp where other users in the same server can read.

What you could do, is assign one of your Elastic IP's to the instance and route traffic through that normally. Snapshot the instance and bring up a duplicate with a new Keypair. Switch the Elastic IP over to the new instance.

The best solution we have been able to come up with is to burn an AMI from the running instance and launch a new instance from that AMI using the new key pair.

And unlike the regular Microsoft .NET Framework, the Mono project does seem to have a PKCS8 implementation for which the full C# source is available. This may be suitable as a starting point in case you absolutely cannot rely on external libraries, assuming the (LGPL 2.0) license associated with the Mono code works for you...
Finally, the PKCS #8 format is not too difficult to parse, and the RSA/DSA key pair objects are as per PKCS #11 and relatively easy to convert to a .NET X509Certificate once you figure out where all the bits go -- I actually did this in VB.NET a while ago, but unfortunately am not able to share that code.

Then, run the second command:
$ openssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key

$ heroku run openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.pass.key 2048

This seems to work and I can enter a passphrase twice (but there is no confirmation message)
The next stage is to type the following ""$ openssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key"" - so that the private key can be stripped of its passphrase. So:
$ heroku run openssl rsa -in server.pass.key -out server.key

But here I get the following error:

How do I get the correct public key?
How to get the private key?

","To extend Uwe's answer, the reason you see different values is your strange handling of the public key data:
RSAPublicKey pubkey = (RSAPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey();
tempPub = pubkey.getEncoded();
sPub = new String( tempPub );
field=hex(sPub);
System.out.println(""Public key : \n"" + field );

Here you are creating a string from a stream of bytes (never a good idea) and then hex-encoding the result. No wonder it looks weird! In fact, your hex method looks very strange and probably should be thrown away.
Instead, just try this:
RSAPublicKey pubkey = (RSAPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey();
field = DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(pubkey.getEncoded());
System.out.println(""Public key : \n"" + field );

If you are using Java 5 or below, Google for a decent byte-to-hex function as DatatypeConverter is not available.

But if you want to interop with other applications that requires a base64 private key then you need to know the format (inside the base64 string). E.g. in many case private keys are PEM encoded (which is base64 with a special header/footer, see an example for X509Certificate).
If that what's you're looking for then you'll need to encode the private key within a PKCS#8 structure first, then turn in into base64 and add the header/footer. You can find some helpful code to do so inside Mono.Security.dll (MIT.X11 licensed code from the Mono project).

","You cannot generate either key directly from the other. It is mathematically impossible. If you had a key blob that contained both the public and private keys, you could extract either one of them with relative ease.
EDIT, 2017: Many years and a much better understanding of crypto later, and it's now clear to me that this answer isn't really correct.
To quote Wikipedia:

The public key consists of the modulus n and the public (or encryption) exponent e. The private key consists of the modulus n and the private (or decryption) exponent d, which must be kept secret. p, q, and λ(n) must also be kept secret because they can be used to calculate d.

The public modulus n can be computed as p × q. The only thing missing from a raw private key is e, but this value is usually selected as 65537, and if not you can still compute e from d and λ(n).
However, many private key storage formats actually contain the public modulus n alongside the other components, so you can just do a direct extraction of the values.
EDIT, 2018: Still getting downvotes for this, and rightly so! I'm leaving this answer up so people can see why I was originally wrong, and to remind myself not to be wrong in future.

","The assumption is that we are talking about RSA private and Public keys. Then, if you are working from a PEM format file, then first you need to read the private key from the file into a PrivateKey object:
    public PrivateKey readPemRsaPrivateKey(String pemFilename) throws
            java.io.IOException,
            java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException,
            java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException
    {
            String pemString = File2String(pemFilename);

            pemString = pemString.replace(""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"", """");
            pemString = pemString.replace(""-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"", """");

            byte[] decoded = Base64.decodeBase64(pemString);

            PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(decoded);
            KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");

            return kf.generatePrivate(keySpec);
    }

where File2String is something like:
    private static String File2String(String fileName) throws
            java.io.FileNotFoundException, java.io.IOException
    {
            File file = new File(fileName);

            char[] buffer = null;

            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));

            buffer = new char[(int)file.length()];

            int i = 0;
            int c = bufferedReader.read();

            while (c != -1) {
                    buffer[i++] = (char)c;
                    c = bufferedReader.read();
            }
            return new String(buffer);
    }

Now you can generate the corresponding PublicKey with code like this:
    import java.security.interfaces.RSAPrivateCrtKey;
    import java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec;

...
    PrivateKey myPrivateKey = readPemRsaPrivateKey(myPrivateKeyPemFileName);
    RSAPrivateCrtKey privk = (RSAPrivateCrtKey)myPrivateKey;

    RSAPublicKeySpec publicKeySpec = new java.security.spec.RSAPublicKeySpec(privk.getModulus(), privk.getPublicExponent());

    KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
    PublicKey myPublicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);

","Regarding the second part of your question, the data type that should be used for storing the key would be VARBINARY(256).
Back to the first part of your question, you actually have the option of having SQL Server handle the encryption for you.  Granted, whether or not you would want to do this would be a matter of what your application requirements are, but I'll go over it in case it's an option.
We'll be pretty basic here and just use symmetric keys and Triple-DES.
First, the database has a master key which is used to protect certificates and asymmetric keys.  The master key is encrypted with Triple-DES.
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'supersecretpassword'  

SQL Server 2005/2008 can generate their own X.509 certificates used to protect the keys used to encrypt the actual data.
CREATE CERTIFICATE ExampleCertificate 
     WITH SUBJECT = 'thisisjustsomemetadata'

There are a lot of options for encrypting symmetric keys (certificates, passwords, other keys), as well as many supported algorithms.  But for this example, we'll use our certificate.
CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY ExampleKey
     WITH ALGORITHM = TRIPLE_DES  
     ENCRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE EncryptTestCert 

The key needs to be decrypted using the same method with which it was encrypted.  In our case, this would be the certificate we created.
 DECLARE @Value VARCHAR(50)
 SET @Value = 'supersecretdata!'

 OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY ExampleKey DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE ExampleCertificate  
     UPDATE SomeTable  
     SET SomeColumn = ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('ExampleKey'), @Value)

Decryption is just as straightforward.
OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY ExampleKey DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE ExampleCertificate  
     SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(50),DECRYPTBYKEY(SomeColumn)) AS DecryptedData 
     FROM SomeTable 

Hopefully this solved your problem, or at least opened you up to alternative solutions (though someone who's had experience doing encryption in C# apps could probably find the fault in your above code).  If you have requirements that necessitate that the data can't even go over the wire to the SQL Server in plain-text, obviously this is a no-go (well, you can actually create SSL connections to SQL Server...).

","As long as the object is marked as serializable, one way to convert an object to a byte array is to use the BinaryFormatter class in .Net.
You will need to add this using statement to your code file:
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;

A binary formatter can output your class to a stream. As you intend to convert your object to a byte array, you can use a System.IO.MemoryStream as temporary storage.
MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream();

You can then create a new binary formatter.
BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinarryFomatter();

and use this to serialize your object.
formatter.Serialize(memStream, someObject);

To get the bytes you can use:
return memStream.ToArray();

To deserialize the byte array you need to write the bytes to a memory stream.
memStream.Write(arrBytes, 0, arrBytes.Length);

Return to the beginning of the stream.
memStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

Then use the formatter to recreate the object.
Object obj = (Object)formatter.Deserialize(memStream);

If you are already using encryption functions you should be able to encrypt the created byte array quite easily before storing it in the database. 
Hopefully that will help you in the right direction. If you are lucky, the BouncyCastle objects will be marked as serializable, if not you will need some extra code. Later, I will get a chance to look at the BouncyCastle librarys to be able to test this and will post more code if necessary.

... I have never used BouncyCastle before. After some testing, it appears that the public and private key objects are not serializable, so you will need to convert these objects into something that is!
It appears that the public and private keys expose properties as various BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger values. (The keys can also be constructed from these BigIntegers). Further, BigIntegers have a ToByteArray() function and can also be constructed from a byte array. Very useful..
Knowing that you can break each key into BigIntegers and these in turn to a byte array and that the reverse is also possible, you a way to store all these in a serializable object. A simple struct or class would do e.g.
[Serializable]
private struct CipherPrivateKey
{
    public byte[] modulus;
    public byte[] publicExponent;
    public byte[] privateExponent;
    public byte[] p;
    public byte[] q;
    public byte[] dP;
    public byte[] dQ;
    public byte[] qInv;
}

[Serializable]
private struct CipherPublicKey
{
    public bool isPrivate;
    public byte[] modulus;
    public byte[] exponent;
}

This gives us a pair of easy to use serializable objects.
The AsymmetricCipherKeyPair exposes the Public and Private keys as AsymmetricKeyParameter objects. To get at the more detailed properties you will need to cast these to the following:
keyPair.Public to BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaKeyParameters
keyPair.Private to BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters
The following functions will convert these to the structs to declared earlier:
private static CipherPublicKey getCipherPublicKey(Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaKeyParameters cPublic)
{
    CipherPublicKey cpub = new CipherPublicKey();
    cpub.modulus = cPublic.Modulus.ToByteArray();
    cpub.exponent = cPublic.Exponent.ToByteArray();
    return cpub;
}
private static CipherPrivateKey getCipherPrivateKey(Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters cPrivate)
{
    CipherPrivateKey cpri = new CipherPrivateKey();
    cpri.dP = cPrivate.DP.ToByteArray();
    cpri.dQ = cPrivate.DQ.ToByteArray();
    cpri.modulus = cPrivate.Modulus.ToByteArray();
    cpri.p = cPrivate.P.ToByteArray();
    cpri.privateExponent = cPrivate.Exponent.ToByteArray();
    cpri.publicExponent = cPrivate.PublicExponent.ToByteArray();
    cpri.q = cPrivate.Q.ToByteArray();
    cpri.qInv = cPrivate.QInv.ToByteArray();
    return cpri;
}

Using the binary formatter mentioned earlier, we can convert the serializable objects we have just created to a byte array.
CipherPublicKey cpub = getCipherPublicKey((Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaKeyParameters)keypair.Public);
MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream();
BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinarryFomatter();
formatter.Serialize(memStream, cpub);
return memStream.ToArray();

Desierializing is then just the inverse as described earlier. Once you have either the public or private structs deserialized you can use the BouncyCastle contructors to recreate the keys. These functions demonstrate this.
private static Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaKeyParameters recreateASymCipherPublicKey(CipherPublicKey cPublicKey)
{
    Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaKeyParameters key;
    key = new Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaKeyParameters(
            cPublicKey.isPrivate,
            createBigInteger(cPublicKey.modulus),
            createBigInteger(cPublicKey.exponent));
    return key;
}

private static Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters recreateASymCipherPrivateKey(CipherPrivateKey cPrivateKey)
{
    Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters key;
    key = new Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters.RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters(
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.modulus),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.publicExponent),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.privateExponent),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.p),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.q),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.dP),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.dQ),
            createBigInteger(cPrivateKey.qInv));
    return key;
}

If you need to recreate the original key pair for any reason:
AsymmetricKeyParameter publ = (AsymmetricKeyParameter)recreateASymCipherPublicKey(cKeyPair.publicKey);
AsymmetricKeyParameter priv = (AsymmetricKeyParameter)recreateASymCipherPrivateKey(cKeyPair.privateKey);
AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair = new AsymmetricCipherKeyPair(publ, priv);

Hopefully that all makes sense! The code samples should help you on your way.

","For reasons that should be clear, default (and perhaps inadvertent) serialization does not play well with private keys which should only be written out in very limited situations.
BouncyCastle has support for PKCS#8, which is the relevant standard for ""serializing"" private keys. There are ASN.1 structures called PrivateKeyInfo and EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo. Since they are in ASN.1 there are standard ways to serialize/deserialize them. As the name suggests, one stores the key in plaintext, the other encrypts the key based on a password.
For the public keys - these would not ordinarily be encrypted. BC supports the X.509 standard format of SubjectPublicKeyInfo for serializing them.
In the C# build, the high-level classes to look at would be:

Org.BouncyCastle.Security.PrivateKeyFactory
Org.BouncyCastle.Security.PublicKeyFactory
Org.BouncyCastle.Pkcs.EncryptedPrivateKeyInfoFactory
Org.BouncyCastle.Pkcs.PrivateKeyInfoFactory

","What you mean is not called ""encryption"" but ""signing"" in gpg lingo.
Signing is basically encrypting with your private key and decrypting with the public key.
Use
 gpg --sign myfile.ext

Or use your email-client's signing capabilities.
Signing will obviously allow anybody who has access to your ""public"" key to read the contents of your file (and since a ""public"" key is usually, well..., public, this will allow everybody to decypher the content).
If you are looking for a method, where only the recipient can decode the content, then you need to encrypt the data in a way where only the recipient has access to the decrypting token. obviously the recipient need to have such a token (that is: you encode with their public key, so they can decode with their private key)
UPDATE
To make it simple: if you want to guarantee integrity (that is: the recipient knows for sure, that the data comes from you and nobody else), you need to sign the data.
If you want to guarantee confidentiality (that is: only your recipient can read the data), you need to encrypt the data.
Both signing and encryption are really the same thing.
The only difference is, who has access to the keys.
With signing, you use your private key to encrypt the data, and it can be decrypted with your public key (and since everybody has access to the public key, everybody can decrypt it, and thus everybody can validate that the data has been signed by you)
With encrypting, you use your recipients public key to encrypt the data, and they use their private key to decrypt it (so only they can read it; but everybody can send them an encrypted datum, they have no guarantee that it really comes from the sender, but it is guaranteed that only they can read it).
If you need both confidentiality and integrity, you need to do both signing and encryption, and for this to work, both you and your recipients need to have a (different) public/private key pair.
CONCLUSION
Since both signing and encrypting are the same thing, you can use both to guarantee validity and integrity of your data, as long as you have full control over the availability of the keys involved.

","It is not true that GnuPG requires you to publish your private key in order to encrypt a document. You should never publish your private key to anyone.
GnuPG supports two different encryption methods, asymmetric and symmetric encryption.
Asymmetric encryption requires to to know the public key of your recipient. This is usually not a problem because as the name already suggests these keys are not a secret but known to everyone. For decrypting it again only the private key can be used which is known only to your recipient. Asymmetric encryption using GnuPG is done with the --encrypt option.
If you don't know the public key of your recipient then you can use symmetric encryption where both parties share the same key. This requires a secure channel for transmitting the shared secret, of course. For symmetric encryption, use the --symmetric option. Neither a public nor a private key is required here but the secure exchange of the shared key makes symmetric encryption prone to attacks.
If you just need integrity and accountability (the document can't be modified without detecting it and you are able to verify who created/signed it) then you can use the --sign option to create a signature using your private key. Everybody having access to your public key can check this signature to verify both integrity and accountability. But note that everybody can read your original message content because this signature is no encryption. The resulting .gpg-file looks like binary data but only contains compressed but not encrypted text. You can also disable compression by specifying --compress-level 0 and you will see that the output file contains your original message in plaintext. So don't use this option if you want confidentiality.

","Simple answer: forget the idea of keys. You only need a shared secret passphrase. So get together with your client. Call them on the phone. Or if you're paranoid, do it face to face. Agree on a passphrase you will share and keep it as secret as you need to. Based on my experience, I recommend using diceware together to pick a shared passphrase. Both of you keep a secure copy of that shared secret. If you're paranoid, don't write it down—memorize it! Now you can encrypt anything using that shared secret as the passphrase. Any symmetric encryption tool can do that for you, including GPG.

I don't want to send my private key so that I can change it and send public key to anyone else . Any idea how to do that???
","I am working on a similar problem: distribute software updates from a central source to be applied to many end-users in the field.  End users need to validate that the update came from the official source (signed with private key), but I also want the update to travel confidentially (encrypted).
In the cryptography course I had at University ~30 years ago now, they taught that encrypting with one's private key was the same thing as signing a message - when the recipient decrypts using the public key, the fact that they do not get gibberish confirms use of the private key to encrypt.  This also provides a measure of confidentiality if the public key is kept ""close to the vest,"" which would be my preferred implementation.
As mentioned by others, I have confirmed that the gpg --sign operation does not encrypt the message, the message is visible in plaintext in the signed file.  To use gpg to accomplish both certain authenticity with a signature from the private key, and a reasonable measure of confidentiality, I have settled on the solution of giving the field based receivers their own key pair, in addition to the public key of the update distributor.  This isn't a terribly secure solution, anyone can reverse engineer a device in the field and get ahold of the ""secret"" key that it will hold, with that they can decrypt the signed update message and see its cleartext contents.  What they cannot do is create a file with the distributor's secret key signature on it, and so they cannot make an update of their own that will be accepted by the devices in the field which are looking for both encryption with their public key, and a signature from the update distributor's privately held key.
It's a matter of degrees of exposure.  The updates in transit are secure from anyone who does not have access to an endpoint device to reverse engineer.  With physical access to an endpoint (something we cannot prevent), they will eventually be able to reverse engineer the installed software, and even the updates themselves, but they will never be able to sign their own update and push it to un-compromised machines.  At least as long as RSA is secure.

As you're not passing a password and your key is encrypted this exception will always be thrown. There's only one way round this problem, to actually give the method a password. You, therefore, need a way of getting the password out of the OSXKeychain.

Is there a way to make paramiko use the password / fetch it from the keychain, like ssh does?
","The following approach seems to work fine (on OS X, with the usual setup of encrypted private keys that have passphrases stored in the keychain, without any user interaction):
import paramiko

ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.load_system_host_keys()
ssh.connect(HOST, username=USER, look_for_keys=False)
...
ssh.close()

It seems that look_for_keys=False is not absolutely necessary. However, if you use it you will get much better error messages in the case of an authentication failure (""AuthenticationException"" instead of ""PasswordRequiredException"").

If you really want to use private keys directly, you could do the following:
import os
import paramiko
import keyring

keyfile = os.path.expanduser('~/.ssh/id_rsa')
password = keyring.get_password('SSH', keyfile)
key = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(keyfile, password=password)

However, based on my testing, this is not needed. The above solution that uses ssh.connect in a straightforward manner should be sufficient.

Is there a way to make paramiko use the password / fetch it from the keychain, like ssh does?
","Using encrypted private key in Paramiko is not possible, because ssh-agent doesn't give private key (without memory dump).
The solution would be to use subprocess and call ssh command from that (as any usual command). It didn't me ask for decryption of the private key (it uses ssh agent, you can find that using ssh -vvv). 
BTW, I couldn't find benefits of using paramiko. SSH agent seems more developed and more general tool. For example, it's not possible to forward SSH agent in paramiko, one has to resort to subprocess for that. Also note this issue from 2014, ""Key handling is terribad"" (open): 

SSHClient._auth uses a multi-exit strategy combined with storing a single exception to raise at the end of the process. This frequently means the raised exception at auth time is flat out incorrect as to the true cause of the inability to authenticate. 

There are many paramiko bugs linked in this thread. It seems actively developed now, and I hope paramiko will fix that, but my advice is: don't rely on one single library, it may not fulfill your demands.
Yes, there is a possibility to provide password to the encrypted key, but that defeats the purpose of that. You either enter password yourself (then you don't need a key for ssh), or store the password on disk (of course not in version control), then you don't need the private key to be encrypted (the idea of that is that if someone gets your HDD, one doesn't get your private keys in plain text).

TH above key is in PKCS#8 format.
I want to convert it into a RSA Private Key PKCS#1 format
The command I use is:
openssl rsa -in servenc.key -out serv.key

The output which i get is in the below format:

"12060865","openssl_pkey_new() throwing errors -- Proper openssl.cnf setup for php","**Okay, It's become clear that this issue is an issue related with the setup of openssl on the Linux server and how to properly setup a custom openssl.cnf file. I am not looking for anything complicated but I need a front-end to be able to create self-signed client certificates for authentication to my webservice. So I need to be able to use my CA to create intermediate CAs for client companies and then allow them a secure interface to issue client certificates for their employees. Logins are based on whether you belong to a specific intermediate CA and that your certificate or the intermediate CA hasn't be revoked. 
For anyone wondering, we can use self-signed certificates because they are only used for our server to authenticate users and since we issued them, we trust them. Also it would be way too expensive for a startup to establish themselves as an intermediate CA through the commercial offerings AFAIK. Microsoft can do that, we can't. Our webserver itself uses a CA signed certificate.
I know that php code for setting this kind of thing up is straight forward but what isn't is how to properly setup openssl. I have tried several different examples on the net and none of them seem to work for my setup and they all seem to be different. One box was fresh install of Centos 6.2 and I am still getting errors. 
Can anyone point me in the proper direction for setting up openssl, apache2 and php so that I can use these php libraries without errors? Our virtual server is using debian squeeze and I have full control of software installed.
Thanks.
open_pkey_new() is returning errors such as error:0E06D06C:configuration file routines:NCONF_get_string:no value. Yet I am passing a path to a openssl.cnf file so I don't know why I'm still getting this problem. Here's my relevent code
<?php
$cwd=getcwd();
$distname= array(
    ""countryName"" => ""CA"",
    ""stateOrProvinceName"" => ""Ontario"",

$cnf=$cwd.'/certs/myopenssl.cnf';
$configArgs = array(

?>

Here's my function that makes the keys.
<?php
function makekey($password,$configArgs) {
    $key= openssl_pkey_new($configArgs);
    //print_r($configArgs);

        } while($e=openssl_error_string());
        return -1;
    }
}

I've tried relative paths too to the configfile and it still won't work. Looks like it might be the host providers ssl setup. I switched to a local virtual machine and I got the key to generate but now I'm getting the same error when creating a csr.

","I tried this on my Mac and a fresh install of CentOS 6.3 and I'm getting the same error. I get my CentOS packages from IUS. It's weird though because even though I'm getting this message, the key is actually being generated.
The following code:
$res = openssl_pkey_new();
openssl_pkey_export($res, $privkey);
var_dump(openssl_error_string());
var_dump($privkey);

Gives me the following output:

I suspect it being a bug in PHP. Some sort of openssl configuration PHP is getting hung up on. I found a bug report about this on php.net, but it ""started working"" for the user so the bug was closed.
As an alternative, you can check out phpseclib, a library purely written in PHP.

open_pkey_new() is returning errors such as error:0E06D06C:configuration file routines:NCONF_get_string:no value. Yet I am passing a path to a openssl.cnf file so I don't know why I'm still getting this problem. Here's my relevent code

","Based on the bug @Luke mentioned, my conclusion would be:
openssl_pkey_new() doesn't return a value and therefore is ""FALSE"".
var_dump() just says it returns an OpenSSL key.
""So it works - ""NCONF_get_string:no value"" is only some kind of notice."" - vrana@php.net
openssl_csr_new() (and maybe more) have a similar behavior.

"12060865","openssl_pkey_new() throwing errors -- Proper openssl.cnf setup for php","**Okay, It's become clear that this issue is an issue related with the setup of openssl on the Linux server and how to properly setup a custom openssl.cnf file. I am not looking for anything complicated but I need a front-end to be able to create self-signed client certificates for authentication to my webservice. So I need to be able to use my CA to create intermediate CAs for client companies and then allow them a secure interface to issue client certificates for their employees. Logins are based on whether you belong to a specific intermediate CA and that your certificate or the intermediate CA hasn't be revoked. 
For anyone wondering, we can use self-signed certificates because they are only used for our server to authenticate users and since we issued them, we trust them. Also it would be way too expensive for a startup to establish themselves as an intermediate CA through the commercial offerings AFAIK. Microsoft can do that, we can't. Our webserver itself uses a CA signed certificate.
I know that php code for setting this kind of thing up is straight forward but what isn't is how to properly setup openssl. I have tried several different examples on the net and none of them seem to work for my setup and they all seem to be different. One box was fresh install of Centos 6.2 and I am still getting errors. 
Can anyone point me in the proper direction for setting up openssl, apache2 and php so that I can use these php libraries without errors? Our virtual server is using debian squeeze and I have full control of software installed.
Thanks.
open_pkey_new() is returning errors such as error:0E06D06C:configuration file routines:NCONF_get_string:no value. Yet I am passing a path to a openssl.cnf file so I don't know why I'm still getting this problem. Here's my relevent code
<?php
$cwd=getcwd();
$distname= array(
    ""countryName"" => ""CA"",
    ""stateOrProvinceName"" => ""Ontario"",
    ""localityName"" => ""Toronto"",
    ""organizationName"" => ""G4 Apps"",
    ""organizationalUnitName"" => ""Development"",
    ""commonName"" => ""Mark Lane"",
    ""emailAddress"" => ""nobody at gmail.com""
        );
$password = 'seanix';

$cacert_location=$cwd.""/certs/CA/g4CA.crt"";
$cakey_location=$cwd.""/certs/CA/g4CA.key"";
$cnf=$cwd.'/certs/myopenssl.cnf';
$configArgs = array(
        'config' =>$cnf
);
?>

Here's my function that makes the keys.
<?php
function makekey($password,$configArgs) {
    $key= openssl_pkey_new($configArgs);
    //print_r($configArgs);
    openssl_pkey_export($key, $pkeyout,$password);
    if (($e=openssl_error_string()) ==false) return $pkeyout;
    else {
        do {

            echo $e . ""<BR>"";
        } while($e=openssl_error_string());
        return -1;
    }
}
?>

I've tried relative paths too to the configfile and it still won't work. Looks like it might be the host providers ssl setup. I switched to a local virtual machine and I got the key to generate but now I'm getting the same error when creating a csr.
error:0E06D06C:configuration file routines:NCONF_get_string:no value
<?php
function newcsr($distname,$key,$configArgs) {
    $csr=openssl_csr_new($distname,$key,$configArgs);
    openssl_csr_export($csr, $csrout);
    if (($e=openssl_error_string()) ==false) return $csrout;
    else {
        do {

            echo $e . ""<BR>"";
        } while($e=openssl_error_string());
        return -1;
    }
}
?>

openssl.conf This looks to be an error in openssl.cnf so I've included the file.

","Take a look at this link. It says,
Generates an X.509 v1 self-signed certificate, using keystore information including
the private key and public key associated with alias

So you can update a certificate using -selfcert that are associated with a key. Your first and third are trusted certificate entries, where as your second entry is a PrivateKeyEntry. The certificate for this entry is associated with its PrivateKey. Where as the other 2 are not.
If those 2 certificates are expired you can only update them with the latest in the same way you added them to the keystore in the first place. By doing -importcert.
Note: -selfcert is now obsolete. You can read more about it here.

","If you open the key with PuTTY Key Generator, you can export your key in the OpenSSH format.  Just copy that to your mac and put it as a file named id_rsa in your ~/.ssh directory (which you'll have to create if you haven't run ssh-keygen).

If it's not too much trouble though you can just use ssh-keygen to create a new key pair and add the new id_rsa.pub public key to the account you're accessing.  Most online git repositories and ssh hosts (like Winsshd) allow you to link multiple keys to an account.

"26042410","How to store key using Android Key Store Provider","I am trying to use the Android Key Store Provider that became available in Android 4.3 to securely save a Private Key and to then use this private key to encrypt and decode data.
I think I have implemented the correct approach and code for this so far however I am currently facing an odd issue that I cannot figure out.
I have a class called KeyStorage that I use to create the Key pair, load the KeyStore and retrieve the private key, the code for this class is as follows:
public class KeyStorage {

public static final String ANDROID_KEYSTORE = ""AndroidKeyStore"";
private KeyStore keyStore;

public void loadKeyStore() {
    try {
        keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(ANDROID_KEYSTORE);
        keyStore.load(null);
        Enumeration<String> aliases = keyStore.aliases();
        while(aliases.hasMoreElements())
            Log.e(""E"", ""Aliases = "" + aliases.nextElement());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // TODO: Handle this appropriately in your app
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

public void generateNewKeyPair(String alias, Context context)
        throws Exception {

    Calendar start = Calendar.getInstance();
    Calendar end = Calendar.getInstance();
    // expires 1 year from today
    end.add(1, Calendar.YEAR);

    KeyPairGeneratorSpec spec = new KeyPairGeneratorSpec.Builder(context)
            .setAlias(alias)
            .setSubject(new X500Principal(""CN="" + alias))
            .setSerialNumber(BigInteger.TEN)
            .setStartDate(start.getTime())
            .setEndDate(end.getTime())
            .build();

    // use the Android keystore
    KeyPairGenerator gen = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"", ANDROID_KEYSTORE);
    gen.initialize(spec);

    // generates the keypair
    gen.generateKeyPair();
}

public PrivateKey loadPrivteKey(String alias) throws Exception {

    if (keyStore.isKeyEntry(alias)) {
        Log.e(""E"", ""Could not find key alias: "" + alias);
        return null;
    }

    KeyStore.Entry entry = keyStore.getEntry(EnhancedCredentialStore.KEY_ALIAS, null);

    if (!(entry instanceof KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry)) {
        Log.e(""E"", "" alias: "" + alias + "" is not a PrivateKey"");
        return null;
    }

    return ((KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry) entry).getPrivateKey();
}

I then have a class called CredentialStore that I try to use this in. I create an alias called ""MySecureKey"" and try to create and store a private key based on this. So as you can see I try to create the new Key pair based on the Alias load the keystore and then finally retrieve the Private key. However it doesn't work.
public class CredentialStore {

public static final String KEY_ALIAS  = ""MySecureKey"";

private KeyStorage KeyStorage;

public CredentialStore(Activity context){

    keyStorage = new KeyStorage();
    try {
        keyStorage.generateNewKeyPair(KEY_ALIAS, context);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    blueBirdKeyStorage.loadKeyStore();

    try {
        keyStorage.loadPrivteKey(KEY_ALIAS);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

}

I get the logs as follow:
Aliases = MySecureKey
Could not find key alias: MySecureKey

So when I check the aliases in the loadKeyStore method it looks like it is there as it is coming back in the log. However when I try to call it using the loadKeyStore method I get the log saying it can not find the key ""MySecureKey"".
I cannot find any reason for this and researching online has proven unfruitful so I was wondering if anyone has any idea what might be going wrong?
","Why is it blueBirdKeyStore in:
blueBirdKeyStorage.loadKeyStore();

Shouldn't it be:
keyStorage.loadKeyStore();

Also, you haven't used the 'alias' in your loadPrivateKey():
KeyStore.Entry entry = keyStore.getEntry(EnhancedCredentialStore.KEY_ALIAS, null);

Now, I'm not sure, but shouldn't you be using the 'alias' in this?

I cannot find any reason for this and researching online has proven unfruitful so I was wondering if anyone has any idea what might be going wrong?
","loadPrivateKey in your class does not use the ""alias"" to retrieve the key. It's using another class's constant so I'm not sure what's you're expecting here.

","Your method to check if your key exists is flawed:
if (keyStore.isKeyEntry(alias)) {
    Log.e(""E"", ""Could not find key alias: "" + alias);
    return null;
}

According to the javadoc .isKeyEntry() has the following behavior

Returns true if the entry identified by the given alias was created by
  a call to setKeyEntry, or created by a call to setEntry with a
  PrivateKeyEntry or a SecretKeyEntry.

but your key was not created through setEntry(). I guess if you just load the key with 
KeyStore.Entry entry = ks.getEntry(alias, null);

it won't be null.

","First of all, I hope that's not the RSA private key that you are going to use in production.
As regards to doing the encryption/decryption on JavaScript side, there are various libraries such as Standford's JSBN RSA Encryption library and ohdave.com's RSA in JavaScript utility for doing simple encryption/decryption, but your main concern with these tools and even your architecture is performance. I would not do RSA encryption with JavaScript unless it was absolutely necessary and there were no other workarounds.

","I had the same symptom, but an altogether different cause. As many developers do, I have a bunch of different tool chains installed on my system. I just surveyed them to show how this can look; scroll to the bottom of this answer for the full list.
I had installed my code-signing certificate from VeriSign to the system certificate store (requires /sm with signtool.exe) as usual, using certutil -importPFX cert.pfx from an elevated command prompt.
First tests looked promising, but then suddenly the signing started to fail.
To debug the issue I first started using signtool.exe sign /debug /v /a /sm ... in order to see what goes wrong. The output looked like this (also see question):

I could rule out the missing private key, as the certificate store indicated clearly I have a matching private key:

Now I remember that there were some recent patches that allow Windows 7 to accept signatures made with a certificate that has a SHA256 hash. Although, of course, most older articles will state that Windows 7 cannot handle SHA-2 hashes at all.
So this already gave me a nudge into the direction of ""it's got to be an old version of something involved in signing"".
I still decided to remove the certificate plus key and reimport it using the invocation shown before.
Then, after surveying my system (see at the bottom of the answer), I found a whopping five different versions of signtool.exe. So I started by trying the newest one (6.3.9600.17298, from the Windows 8.1 SDK) and it worked immediately:

Tracking this down further I thought I had found the issue. However, it turned out that the error I got is not what I would have gotten to see with the older signtool.exe versions. Instead older versions would have complained about /ac, /fd and /ph being unrecognized command line options, respectively.
So I needed to dig a little deeper and it turned out that my (alternative) file manager was the culprit. I usually start my command prompts in the respective folder using that file manager and a handy keyboard shortcut. It turns out that it sometimes does not pass the environment variables - essentially the file manager ""forgets"" the environment variables. This turned out to be the root cause. A command prompt opened using Win+R and then cmd Enter would not expose this behavior despite executing signtool.exe from the same folder.
My best guess from this is that due to a messed up PATH variable or similar, signtool.exe ended up picking the wrong DLL. Notably mssign32.dll and wintrust.dll accompany signtool.exe in the same folder for the Windows SDK 8.0 and 8.1, but not for any of the earlier versions of signtool.exe which will pick the ""global"" system-wide DLLs, whatever they turn out to be.

On my system I had five different versions of signtool.exe.
signtool.exe 5.2.3790.1830
Doesn't even understand the /ac and /ph arguments I was using (also not /fd). But strangely enough worked without those two arguments.

","I had same problem as mentioned. This is what I did - assuming you have setup the rest of the pre-requisites for code signing.

Closed the solution and closed the VS IDE
Launched the Visual Studio IDE with Run as Administrator privileges
Open the solution and rebuild it

This time the signing process was successful.
I presume you have the right cert file and private key for signing and also imported the cert to the Trusted store.
If not, you can continue to read more.

Import the pfx file - ""xyz.pfx"" :: Open command prompt (launch - Run
as Administrator privileges) and run the following command 
certutil.exe -p mypassword -importpfx xyz.pfx
An output from the command is shown below as example:

Certificate ""CN=Name of the Cert, O=BLAH, OU=BLAH, E=john.doe@yourorg.com"" added to 
  store.
  CertUtil: -importPFX command completed successfully.

Add the certificate to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities by using the following command. There are many ways to do but I used this. Open command prompt (launch - Run as Administrator privileges) and run the following command
certmgr.exe -add -c mycertificate.cer -s -r localMachine root
You will see an output message like this

CertMgr Succeeded

Sign the assembly. Simple process from Visual Studio IDE.

Right click the Project in your solution and open its properties.
Open Signing section and click on Sign the Assembly check box (Enable it)
Choose the pfx file using Browse option and enter the password 

you can also create a new one but you need a cert file that match to this pfx file, otherwise your signing will fail.
Save the changes
Now, Click on Build Events section and click Edit Post-Build to open the editor for post build events. Enter the following command.
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.18362.0\x64\signtool.exe"" sign /v /sm ""$(TargetPath)""

Path of the signtool.exe depends on where/whether you have installed the Windows SDK.



Now build the solution, your solution should build successfully and your binaries signed. Ensure to run the VS IDE with Administrator privileges.

Generate your keys
These are the shell commands to generate the keys. You can run these in Linux, Mac, Cygwin, or even your Windows Git BASH.
Generate a 512 bit rsa private key. This will ask you for a password. You need to store this safely.
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 512
Generate the public key based on the private key. You are free to store this in an insecure manner. 
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
Use PHP to encrypt/decrypt data with your keys

I have found this example here that references allow_agent=True but this does not appear to be a parameter that can be used with the SFTPClient.
Can anyone advise if it is possible to work with Paramiko and Pageant in this way?
This is my code at the moment - which raises PasswordRequiredException
privatekeyfile = 'path to key'
mykey = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(privatekeyfile)
transport = paramiko.Transport(('host', 'port'))
transport.connect('username',pkey = mykey)
sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(transport)

","You have to provide a passphrase, when loading an encrypted key using the PKey.from_private_key_file.
Though note that you do not have to load the key at all, when using the Pageant. That's the point of using an authentication agent. But only the SSHClient class supports the Pageant. The Transport class does not, on its own.
You can follow the code in How to use Pageant with Paramiko on Windows?
Though as the allow_agent is True by default, there is actually nothing special about the code.
Once connected and authenticated, use the SSHClient.open_sftp method to get your instance of the SFTPClient.  
ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.connect(host, username='user', allow_agent=True)
sftp = ssh.open_sftp()

The solution provided looks for files on the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys (not in sub directories) and C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA (and subdirectories)
However since I want the setup to install the application to all users, the custom action is running under the SYSTEM-User, which leads the files beeing actually created in C:\ProgramData\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-18.
When running an ""normal"" application as Admin (right click -> Run as Admin) executing exactly the same code, a file is created at C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-21-1154405193-2177794320-4133247715-1000. 
The certificate generated using the WIX custom action seems to not have a private key (""The key set does not exists""), while the cert generated by the ""normal"" application does.
When looking at the permissions of the files, they seem to be alright, even if they differ (the working one does include the SYSTEM user), even after adding the SYSTEM one to the (""non-working"")file I am not able to read the private key, same error here.
Then I used the FindPrivateKey util the find the corresponding file but all I get is ""Unable to obtain private key file name"".
Ok whats going one here? Where does Windows store the private keys for certificates stored by the SYSTEM user? Maybe there isn't any private key file created? Why?
","I got a solution by googleing up nearly everything ... as I understand there are some things to do:

Generate a X509Certificate2
Make sure the private key container is persistent (not temporary)
Make sure to have acccess rules for authenticated users, so they can see the private key

So the final code a came up with is the following:
X509Certificate2 nonPersistentCert = CreateACertSomehow();

// this is only required since there's no constructor for X509Certificate2 that uses X509KeyStorageFlags but a password
// so we create a tmp password, which is not reqired to be secure since it's only used in memory
// and the private key will be included (plain) in the final cert anyway
const string TMP_PFX_PASSWORD = ""password"";

// create a pfx in memory ...
byte[] nonPersistentCertPfxBytes = nonPersistentCert.Export(X509ContentType.Pfx, TMP_PFX_PASSWORD);

// ... to get an X509Certificate2 object with the X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet flag set
X509Certificate2 serverCert = new X509Certificate2(nonPersistentCertPfxBytes, TMP_PFX_PASSWORD,
    X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet | X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet | X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable); // use X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable only if you want the private key to tbe exportable

// get the private key, which currently only the SYSTEM-User has access to
RSACryptoServiceProvider systemUserOnlyReadablePrivateKey = serverCert.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;

// create cspParameters
CspParameters cspParameters = new CspParameters(systemUserOnlyReadablePrivateKey.CspKeyContainerInfo.ProviderType, 
    systemUserOnlyReadablePrivateKey.CspKeyContainerInfo.ProviderName, 
    systemUserOnlyReadablePrivateKey.CspKeyContainerInfo.KeyContainerName)
{
    // CspProviderFlags.UseArchivableKey means the key is exportable, if you don't want that use CspProviderFlags.UseExistingKey instead
    Flags = CspProviderFlags.UseMachineKeyStore | CspProviderFlags.UseArchivableKey,
    CryptoKeySecurity = systemUserOnlyReadablePrivateKey.CspKeyContainerInfo.CryptoKeySecurity
};

// add the access rules
cspParameters.CryptoKeySecurity.AddAccessRule(new CryptoKeyAccessRule(new SecurityIdentifier(WellKnownSidType.AuthenticatedUserSid, null), CryptoKeyRights.GenericRead, AccessControlType.Allow));

// create a new RSACryptoServiceProvider from the cspParameters and assign that as the private key
RSACryptoServiceProvider allUsersReadablePrivateKey = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(cspParameters);
serverCert.PrivateKey = allUsersReadablePrivateKey;

// finally place it into the cert store
X509Store rootStore = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine);
rootStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadWrite);
rootStore.Add(serverCert);

If I change the private key to the value from a .der file it works properly, but I need to generate the private key file from a .pem file.
I attached a screenshot of the bytes printed as string(once hard-coded with \n and once hard-coded without \n) and once from the file.
Bigger Image

The weird thing is that the output from the file is different to the output from the strings.
If I try to encode a .der file with Base64, the result is different than the string in the .pem file. Why is that so?
","You say that the last line is throwing exception, i.e. 
PrivateKey privKey = kf.generatePrivate(keySpec);
Above line works on keyspecs being set correct, i.e.
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(encoded);
So actual problem is with encoded bytes array. Have you done System.out after byte [] encoded = Base64.decode(privKeyPEM); and see what the output is.
I understand that if the message is in MIME format, then after certain characters it appends a combination of carriage return and newline so the strings are not too long for e-mail system or wherever you are using it.
The final String test has some '\n' in the original text which you use. You did get rid of other text in below line,
String privKeyPEM = test.replace(""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"", """");
    privKeyPEM = privKeyPEM.replace(""-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"", """");

But, look at the string, 
""MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAvcCH8WsT1xyrZqq684VPJzOF3hN5DNbowZ96Ie//PN0BtRW2\n"" +
// and so on
         ""-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"";

it may have some more '\n' left which may result in some unwanted characters when you generate keyspec. Try more System.out and see what the encoded byte array is like and also before that check String privKeyPEM and see if any extra character is not left in it.
Hope this hepls.

","OK, problem in RSACrypto. When you encrypt file, it creates every time new keypair (in encrypt). Just remove new keypair generation from encrypt, call newKeyPair direcly, when you need it. 
And that static variables does no good for multi-thread environment. 
I'll suggest to throw RSACrypto class, or rewrite it at least. I don't know why you so afraid of using byte[] type and why you need everything be BASE64 encoded. Code will a lot simple without additional encoding/decoding.
Here is working example (without RSACrypto), you can use it as template:

    writer.flush();
    writer.close();
    file = new File(""C:\\temp-ldi\\privkey.txt"");
    writer = new FileWriter(file);
    file.createNewFile();
    writer.write(new BASE64Encoder().encode(keyPayr.getPrivate().getEncoded()));
    writer.flush();
    writer.close();

The PHP function tries to connect to a ip address using an ssh key file:-
 function minnerConnect($miner_serial) {

    $port = '7822';

Can anybody suggest a fix?
","The error in this case was that the keys were generated by the root user, but they need to be accessible by the web server group/owner www-data.
I didn't like the idea of keeping ssh keys in a web folder open to www-data, so I moved the key files to a new user's home directory (/home/keyuser/) then made them accessible to www-data. Authentication was successful.
Even though the original error was saying it found the file, it couldn't read the file.
A better debug method is to try reading the file via php:
$prv_key = file_get_contents('/var/www/application/files/id_dsa');
print ""<pre>"";
var_export($prv_key);
print ""</pre>"";

","If keys that you add to GitLab aren't making it into .ssh/authorized_keys:

Make sure that sidekiq is running. Keys are added to gitlab-shell in a Sidekiq worker, so if Sidekiq is down or backlogged, they won't make it in. You can check this in the output of ps -fu git and by checking the ""background jobs"" tab on the admin page.
Ensure that GitLab can execute gitlab-shell properly. The Sidekiq worker adds keys by exec'ing a gitlab-shell process. In particular, this won't work if the ssh_user setting is incorrect in gitlab.yml, or if gitlab-shell is installed to a location other than ~/gitlab-shell for that user.
Verify that the server's /home partition isn't full. If the disk that the authorized_keys file is stored on fills up, key appends with fail! This one has gotten me a few times. Use df -h /home to see if you still have room.

Check your logs for error messages from gitlab-shell: depending on the problem, error messages could appear in unicorn's or sidekiq's logs.

"11527374","Encrypt RSA Private Key with AES 256 in Java","I am writing a secure file sharing application in Java.  The general architecture looks like this:

User wishes to encrypt a file for secure sharing between multiple users.
The application generates a random UUID on the client and uses this as the AES 256 password, and encrypts the data with the UUID.
The UUID is then RSA encrypted with each person's public key.  Once per shared user.
Each encrypted UUID packet is stored as part of the file in a custom file header.
The file is then uploaded to a server where others can access it.
The user's can each use their private key to read the AES encryption key and decrypt the file.

Here is the catch.  The user's private key must be encrypted and stored on our servers in our database so that the files can be accessed from multiple locations.  The private key will be encrypted with a user selected password on the client prior to being uploaded to the server.  
I would like to do this using AES 256 bit encryption.  And I would like to do the entire thing without relying on BouncyCastle libraries or any 3rd party libraries.  It needs to use the standard Java 5 libraries, which is why I have chosen to use AES 256 encryption and RSA rather than something like PGP.
Can anyone find anything inherently insecure with this approach, or think of a more efficient way to do this?
Edit:
OK, I'm updating the question because all of the answers I am getting are suggesting that I not transmit the private key to the server.  The reason I need the private key on the server is because the user's need to be able to access their data from multiple clients and multiple locations (ie: their iphone, their ipad, their work laptop, their home pc).  They do not want to have to manage and copy their keys from device to device, which is even more insecure than storing their keys on our server because they would just end up emailing them to themselves at that point.
","The big problem with this is using UUIDs. Although UUIDs are (sort of) guaranteed to be unique, quite a bit of what they contain is quite predictable; substantial amounts remain constant across all the UUIDs generated on a single machine. As such, if a person gets access to (for example) their own key, they can probably guess many other people's keys fairly easily.
The other part that's problematic is storing user's private keys on the server. This makes the whole rest of the scheme relatively fragile, since access to those keys obviously gives access to all the rest of the data. It also (apparently) means you'll normally be decrypting the data on the server, so when the user accesses that data across the network, it'll either need to be re-encrypted for transmission, and decrypted on the users's machine, or else you'll be transmitting the data in the clear (thus rendering most of the encryption useless).
Edit: As to how I think I'd do this:
I'd have a list of public keys on the server. When a client wants to share a file with some other clients, it obtains the public keys for those clients from the server. It then generates a secure random key, and encrypts the data with that key. It then encrypts the random key with the public keys of all the other clients that are supposed to be able to access the data. Put those together into a stream, and transmit them to the server. The other clients can then download the stream, decrypt the key with their private key, and use that to decrypt the data itself.
This means each client's private key remains truly private -- it never has to leave their machine in any form. All they ever have to share with the rest of the world is their public key (which, by definition, shouldn't cause a security problem).
With that, the two obvious lines of attack are against the random number generator, and against RSA itself. For the random number generator, I'd use Java's SecureRandom -- this is exactly the sort of purpose for which it's intended, and if memory serves it's been pretty carefully examined and significant breaks against it seem fairly unlikely.
I won't try to comment on the security of RSA itself. For now, I think your primary concern is with the protocol, not the encryption algorithm proper. Suffice to say that if RSA were significantly broken, you'd obviously need to change your code, but you'd have a lot of company.
With this, it's pretty much up to the client to store their private keys securely. I like smart cards for that job, but there are quite a few alternatives. From the viewpoint of the server and protocol, it's no longer really a factor at all though.
Edit 2: As for dealing with multiple devices, I think I'd simply treat each device as a separate user, with its own public/private key pair. I'd then (probably) group those together by the actual users, so I can easily choose ""Joe Blow"" to give him access on all his devices -- but with a hierarchical display, I could also pretty easily restrict access to a subset of those, so if I want to share it with Joe on his office machine, but it's sensitive enough that I don't want it going where somebody might look over his shoulder while he looks at it, I can pretty easily do that too.
This keeps life simple for the users, but retains the same basic security model (i.e., private keys remain private).

Edit:
OK, I'm updating the question because all of the answers I am getting are suggesting that I not transmit the private key to the server.  The reason I need the private key on the server is because the user's need to be able to access their data from multiple clients and multiple locations (ie: their iphone, their ipad, their work laptop, their home pc).  They do not want to have to manage and copy their keys from device to device, which is even more insecure than storing their keys on our server because they would just end up emailing them to themselves at that point.
","It all depends on how ""secure"" you want the encryption to be.  Obviously RSA is a well document/accepted standard for PKI.  That being said, any time you provide the plaintext as well as the encrypted text, it makes it significantly easier for a hacker to decrypt the ciphertext knowing part of the plaintext.  Here, you are doing precisely that.  Although you are only transmitting the encrypted UUID, by having the same plaintext encrypted with multiple keys gives an attacker significant insight into the payload.  Furthermore, if the hacked is actually one of the recipients, he is able to decode the UUID, and thereby automatically knows the plaintext that is being encrypted by the other users' public keys.
This is not likely a critical issue for you, but just thought I would point out a security risk.
I am not entirely sure why you need to store the user's private key, however.  Furthermore, by using a simple password to encrypt the private key, you have basically reduced the overall security of the entire system to the strength of the user's password.  Finally, if the user loses his password, he is toast; no way to recover any data.
I did something similar in the past but stored the results in a DB.  However, I used the BouncyCastle libraries at the time, so am not sure how to accomplish this without them.

","The scheme you outline is equivalent to CMS (the standard underlying S/MIME) and PGP; fundamentally, it is secure. In CMS, this mode is called ""key transport"". You could also use multi-party ""key agreement,"" with an algorithm like DH or ECDH.
The only problem is that you are using poorly chosen keys for AES.
I can't think of any reason to use a random UUID, which contains non-random bits. Just use the normal key generation mechanism of the Java Cryptography Architecture. Keys, plaintext, and ciphertext should all be represented as byte sequences, unless you need to accommodate some external storage or transport that only accommodates text.
Iterable<Certificate> recipients = null;
KeyGenerator gen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
gen.init(256);
SecretKey contentEncryptionKey = gen.generateKey();

Initialize the AES cipher and let the provider choose an IV.
Cipher contentCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
contentCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, contentEncryptionKey);
AlgorithmParameters params = contentCipher.getParameters();
byte[] iv = params.getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();

For each recipient, initialize the RSA cipher and encrypt the AES key.
Cipher keyEncryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"");
for (Certificate recipient : recipients) {
  keyEncryptionCipher.init(Cipher.WRAP_MODE, recipient);
  byte[] encryptedKey = keyEncryptionCipher.wrap(contentEncryptionKey);
  /* Store the encryptedKey with an identifier for the recipient... */
}
/* Store the IV... */ 
/* Encrypt the file... */

Having users select and remember passwords that give 256 bits of effective strength is unreasonable. To get that strength, you'd have to randomly choose passwords, encode them as text, and have users write them down on a card. If you really need that much strength, you could check out a smart-card–based solution for storing the users' RSA keys.
I'd highly recommend using a CMS library to store your files. It will increase your chances that the protocol you're using is safe, the code you are using has had more review, and that other tools, libraries, and systems can inter-operate with the encrypted messages. BouncyCastle's API is a little obscure, but it might be worth learning it.
(I can't remember if Java 5 supports ""RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-512AndMGF1Padding""; if it does, you should use that instead of PKCS1Padding.)

","OK, this question is asking for a protocol discussion, so it is not completely according to stackoverflow's standards. That said, let's see if we can make some remarks anyway :) :

The Bouncy Castle PGP libraries have a very permissive license, so you can even copy them into a sub-package within your code;
Besides PGP there are also other standard container formats such as CMS or XML encryption, although the latter might not be such a good general purpose format;
Instead of UUID's, I would strongly suggest to use a well seeded PRNG such as the Java JCE ""SHA1PRNG"" to create the AES keys - I don't see any strong reason why you should rely on something like an UUID in your scheme;
AES keys are supposed to consist of random bits to have enough entropy, thinking of them as ""passwords"" is leading into a trap: you cannot use a String as a secure AES key;
The user will have to trust your application and server, you are acting as a trusted third party: you can send user's passwords to your server, you can send incorrect public keys to the users etc. etc. etc.
Your scheme is not protected against any man in the middle attacks (and many argue this cannot be done without using SSL)
Instead of directly encrypting with a password, you should look into something like Password Based Encryption PBKDF2 to encrypt the RSA private key;
Try and add integrity protection when encrypting, from Java 7 onwards you may use AES in GCM mode, it's well worth it.

","Have you have copied the key into the file $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys on the target server? If so, you should probably mention that. If not, that is required for this to work. Also, are you generating the key without a password? If the private key is password protected, you will need to provide that password to addIdentity.
After verifying those things, I'd recommend trying to connect via the command line using OpenSSH, as the Java code you have here looks correct. If the command line does not work, invoke it with -vvv to get verbose output about what it is doing. It is possible that the server is configured with PubkeyAuthentication set to no.

","Make sure the necessary files exist (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub on the client, authorized_keys on the server). Make sure you can use public key authentication with another tool, like ssh, using these files.
If that looks alright, the problem may be with your Java security provider. Read on if you think you have the right files in place.
There are different formats for RSA private key storage, and SSH uses one that is not standard. Most providers expect something called a CRT RSA key, and when JSch doesn't give them a key in that format, they raise an exception which JSch silently eats and goes on to the next authentication method.
What is your provider? The following snippet will help you find out:
import java.security.KeyFactory;
…

KeyFactory f = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
System.out.println(f.getProvider().getName());


Update: I did some checking around, and as of Java 5, the SunPKCS11 provider is installed with the highest precedence on Solaris systems, for performance. Since I don't run Solaris, I can't test it, but I believe this may be causing the problem.
JSch doesn't allow you to specify the provider to use for this operation through its API, so you will have to change the precedence of the installed providers. In fact, I'd suggest trying to remove the SunPKCS11 from this application; run this code once when your application starts up:
Security.removeProvider(""SunPKCS11-Solaris"");

","Short answer

the code that you are using doesn't allow you to do that for security reasons

Long answer 
I was curious about your problem and then I started to try to code
After a while I realized that if you run this snippet you will see that it correctly works:
#!/usr/bin/env python

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
import base64

def generate_keys():
    modulus_length = 1024

    key = RSA.generate(modulus_length)
    #print (key.exportKey())

    pub_key = key.publickey()
    #print (pub_key.exportKey())

    return key, pub_key

def encrypt_private_key(a_message, private_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
    encrypted_msg = encryptor.encrypt(a_message)
    print(encrypted_msg)
    encoded_encrypted_msg = base64.b64encode(encrypted_msg)
    print(encoded_encrypted_msg)
    return encoded_encrypted_msg

def decrypt_public_key(encoded_encrypted_msg, public_key):
    encryptor = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
    decoded_encrypted_msg = base64.b64decode(encoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    decoded_decrypted_msg = encryptor.decrypt(decoded_encrypted_msg)
    print(decoded_decrypted_msg)
    #return decoded_decrypted_msg

def main():
  private, public = generate_keys()
  print (private)
  message = b'Hello world'
  encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, public)
  decrypt_public_key(encoded, private)

if __name__== ""__main__"":
  main()

but if you now change two of the final lines [i.e. the role of the keys] into:
    encoded = encrypt_private_key(message, private)
    decrypt_public_key(encoded, public)

and rerun the program you will get the TypeError: No private key
Let me quote from this great answer: 
""As it turns out, PyCrypto is only trying to prevent you from mistaking one for the other here, OpenSSL or Ruby OpenSSL allow you for example to do both: public_encrypt/public_decrypt and private_encrypt/private_decrypt
[...]
Additional things need to be taken care of to make the result usable in practice. And that's why there is a dedicated signature package in PyCrypto - this effectively does what you described, but also additionally takes care of the things I mentioned""

Final notes: 

the last prints have ascii because as stated here ""In case of base64 however, all characters are valid ASCII characters""
in this case we are using the same key - the private one - both for encrypting and decrypting, so yes: we would end up to be symmetric but...
but - as stated here - ""The public key is PUBLIC - it's something you would readily share and thus would be easily disseminated. There's no added value in that case compared to using a symmetric cipher and a shared key"" plus ""Conceptually, ""encrypting"" with the private key is more useful for signing a message whereas the ""decryption"" using the public key is used for verifying the message""
the same identical last principle is expressed in this answer - ""Typically [...] we say sign with the private key and verify with the public key""

My first instinct was to use OpenSSL, e.g. with a RSA keypair, to do something along the lines of signing by: openssl rsautl -sign -inkey private.pem -in sensitive -out privsigned   and verifying based on the privsigned data and key ONLY: openssl rsautl -verify -inkey public.pem -in privsigned -pubin.

","HMAC is a symmetric algorithm, so there is no separate creation and checking algorithm. To check, you simply compute the hash as it should have been computed originally, and check that the result equals what you actually got from the client. The security rests on the HMAC key only existing on your server.
Unless you need the signatures to be verifiable by someone who doesn't know the secret key, HMAC is probably a better choice than public-key systems, for reasons of efficiency. It can take several milliseconds to create or verify a public-key signature (some years ago I timed one implementation at 15 ms per operation), whereas HMAC is quite fast.
(Oh, and you cannot verify any kind of signature without knowing the data it's supposed to sign. That wouldn't make any sense, as far as I can see).

","As Henning Makholm pointed out, HMAC is a better choice than public key.  There are some best practices you should consider for your particular scenario that will impact your choices:

Do you want to consider the hostname and scheme (http/https) in the signature? Maybe.
Do you want to consider the path in the signature? Probably.
Do you want to consider the query string in the signature? Probably.
Do you want to normalize the argument order and escaping prior to signing? Usually not.
Do you want to embed signature time etc (to create time-limited URLs)?
Do you want to tie the signed URL to some other user state, such as cookie?
Are you using user-generated or user-visible content directly in the HMAC? If so, you should ""salt"" the key using a value that is randomized for each request.

When computing the signature, you'll need to encode it in a URL-friendly way (base64 and base32 are popular choices) and choose an HMAC algorithm (such as SHA-256), and decide how many bits of the signature you want to keep (truncating the HMAC value in half is usually safe).  If you choose base64, beware of the different alphabets used by url-safe vs non-url-safe implementations.
Here is a pseudocode implementation (w/o error checking or salting etc) for signing path + query string:
const secret = ...;

def sign(path, querystring):
  return path + ""?"" + querystring + ""&sig="" + url_encode(base64_encode(hmacsha256(secret, path + ""?"" + querystring).truncate(16)))

def verify(path, querystring):
  querystring_without_sig = remove_query_parameter(querystring, ""sig"")
  sig = base64_decode(url_decode(get_query_parameter(querystring, ""sig"")))
  if hmacsha256(secret, path + ""?"" + querystring_without_sig)[:16] != sig:
    raise ""invalid sig""

HMAC SHA256 is recommended and is available in all common languages.
Java:
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(""HmacSHA256"");
mac.init(secret);
return mac.doFinal(value.getBytes());

Python:
hmac.new(secret, input, hashlib.sha256).digest()

PHP:
hash_hmac(""sha256"", value, secret);

from ska import validate_signed_request_data

validation_result = validate_signed_request_data(
    data = request.GET, # Note, that ``request.GET`` is given as example.
    secret_key = 'your-secret_key'

The validate_signed_request_data produces a SignatureValidationResult object, which basically holds two properties:

result (bool): True if data is valid. False otherwise.
reason (list): List of strings, indicating validation errors.

","This was happening to me too - my setup script would add the cert and grant access to the PK file fine, and the app would work.  Then later, after I had closed the PowerShell editor I re-launched the app and it failed with a keyset not found.  
Adding the PersistKeySet flag when importing the cert fixed the problem.  Here's the PowerShell code for adding the cert and private key with persistence:
param(
    [string]$certStore = ""LocalMachine\TrustedPeople"",
    [string]$filename = ""sp.pfx"",
    [string]$password = ""password"",
    [string]$username = ""$Env:COMPUTERNAME\WebSiteUser""
)

function getKeyFilePath($cert) {
    return ""$ENV:ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\"" + $cert.PrivateKey.CspKeyContainerInfo.UniqueKeyContainerName
}

$certFromFile = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filename, $password)
$certFromStore = Get-ChildItem ""Cert:\$certStore"" | Where-Object {$_.Thumbprint -eq $certFromFile.Thumbprint}
$certExistsInStore = $certFromStore.Count -gt 0
$keyExists = $certExistsInStore -and ($certFromStore.PrivateKey -ne $null) -and (Test-Path(getKeyFilePath($certFromStore)))

if ((!$certExistsInStore) -or (!$keyExists)) {

    $keyFlags = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::MachineKeySet 
    $keyFlags = $keyFlags -bor [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::PersistKeySet
    $certFromFile.Import($filename, $password, $keyFlags)

    $store = Get-Item ""Cert:\$certStore""
    $store.Open(""ReadWrite"")

    if ($certExistsInStore) {
        #Cert is in the store, but we have no persisted private key
        #Remove it so we can add the one we just imported with the key file
        $store.Remove($certFromStore)
    }

    $store.Add($certFromFile)
    $store.Close()

    $certFromStore = $certFromFile
    ""Installed x509 certificate""
}

"10498580","Private keys get deleted unexpectedly in Windows Server 2008 R2","I am facing a strange problem in developing an installation that should in one of the steps install a certificate.
The problem has to do with granting Certificate’s private key access for an account (e.g. IIS_IUSRS) on Windows Server 2008 R2. The private keys are stored in the location C:\Users\All Users\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys.
A custom C# Setup Project imports a Certificate and gives access for an account on Certificate’s private key during the installation process. After some time (2-3 sec) the private key file is automatically deleted from the MachineKeys folder. Thus the installed Web Application cannot access the specific certificate and displays the following error message:
“System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Keyset does not exist”. This error occurs only on Windows Server 2008 R2, while for Windows Server 2003 everything is working correctly.
My question is, why the private key gets deleted and which process does this?
Thx

","http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/security/system/security/cryptography/x509/x509certificate2collection.cs,256 shows where the PersistKeySet flag is tested.  The PersistKeySet flag is documented at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509keystorageflags%28v=vs.110%29.aspx with the phrase ""The key associated with a PFX file is persisted when importing a certificate.""  My techno-babble to English translator tells me this means ""You must include the PersistKeySet flag if you call the X509Certificate2 constructor and the certificate might already be installed on the machine.""  This probably applies to the .Import calls too.  It's likely the powershell Import-PfxCertificate cmdlet already does this.  But if you are doing what the accepted answer shows or what the OP asked, you need to include the special key.  We used a variation of ejegg's script in our solution.  We have a process that runs every 3 minutes to check that all configured certs are installed and this seems to work fine now.
The symptom we saw in powershell is the HasPrivateKey property is true but the PrivateKey value itself is null.  And the key file for the cert in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys was deleted.  The FindPrivateKey utility at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa717039(v=vs.110).aspx helped us watch file get deleted.
So happy 4th birthday to the question with this very late response.

","Perhaps what you're doing wrong is asking here when the freeFTPd site has forums specifically for the type of question you're asking.  Outside of those forums, the best way to debug the type of client that you're using is to first try it against a popular, well-supported server application (such as SSHD on Linux), make sure it works there, and then try it against the lesser known product to see if there are any differences in behavior.

"43438030","Connecting to SFTP with key file using SSH.NET (Permission denied (publickey))","I have a C# console application in Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5.
For testing purposes, I have installed an FTP Server in my local machine and configure it. I have downloaded and installed this free small FTP Server: freeFTPd. It is really easy, it takes me about 10 minutes.
Once I have configured it, I have successfully  connected  using PasswordA uthentication Method using my C# console app.
Now I am trying to only connect to my local FTP server using key based file only.
So the code I have implemented is the following:
var keyFile = new PrivateKeyFile(@""C:\Program Files (x86)\freeFTPd\freeftpd.key"");
var keyFiles = new[] { keyFile };


var methods = new List<AuthenticationMethod>();
methods.Add(new PrivateKeyAuthenticationMethod(username, keyFiles));

var con = new ConnectionInfo(host, port, username, methods.ToArray());
using (SftpClient client = new SftpClient(con))
{
    client.Connect();
    // Do some stuff below
}

As you can see in the above code, I am using freeftpd.key as private key file. This file has been created once freeFTPd is installed. During installation, freeFTPd asked me to create a new private key file so I answered 'yes'. Now I am using it but the problem is that I can connect to my FTP local server using this private key file. I have opened this file, and it starts with following line:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
and ends with:
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Below them there is a bunch of encrypted data.
I have read somewhere that this file must begin with this line.
Anyway I cannot connect to my FTP server.
From freeFTPd control panel, in the section for SFTP, I can create RSA and DSA keys (512, 1024 or 2048 bits of lenght). These files are generated as RSAKey.cfg and DSAKey.cfg and their content are similar to private key file 'freeftpd.key' generated during freeFTPd installation process. If I use RSAKey.cfg or any other just created from freeFTPd it is not working. The error message that appears is:
Permission denied (publickey).

So What I am doing wrong? I have no idea about certificates, private key files... Any help will be highly appreciated.
","In my case I got the message ( (Permission denied (publickey))) when PasswordAuthentication was missing. The server needed the certificate an username/password.
Please try to add both methods as described below. 
I used a combination of SSH.NET as a client and syncplify.me Server.
var keyFile = new PrivateKeyFile(config.SFTPPrivateKeyFilename);
var keyFiles = new[] { keyFile };
var methods = new List<AuthenticationMethod>
{
    new PasswordAuthenticationMethod(config.SFTPUser, config.SFTPPassword),
    new PrivateKeyAuthenticationMethod(config.SFTPUser, keyFiles)
};

return new ConnectionInfo(config.SFTPServer, 22, config.SFTPUser, methods.ToArray());

Our solution consists of creating an administrator account for the local machine. After that we log on with this account and run the MMC /s Command. We import the certificate in LOCAL_MACHINE/My store.

Now my bigproblem is how can I convert the private key from AsimetricAlgorithm object to bate array that contains all the private key?
I saw that I can use openSSl - convert all the certificate to pem file, and then to RSA file - and read the private key, but I dont want to use it because: I dont want to use on files, 3P library, it's not secure and so on..
does anyone know about another way to do that?

","The AsymmetricAlgorithm object you get from the PrivateKey property of your X509Certificate2 will in fact be an instance of one of the various types derived from AsymmetricAlgorithm, such as RSACryptoServiceProvider, DSACryptoServiceProvider, etc...
You will need to determine the type of private key you're dealing with, and cast it appropriately. Once cast, you should be able to call ExportCspBlob(true) to get the private key data.
Example (assuming an RSA key):
public string GetRSAPrivateKeyBase64(X509Certificate2 certificate)
{
    var privateKey = certificate.PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;
    if (privateKey == null) throw new Exception(""Not an RSA private key"");

","You don't encrypt the IV. Bundle it with the encrypted key and send it (in the clear) to the recipient.
Standards for this do exist. This scheme is called ""KeyTransRecipientInfo"" in CMS (upon which S/MIME is based), and PGP offers a similar mode. TLS also includes the initialization vector as a parameter in the key encryption algorithm identifier, using the same ASN.1 syntax as CMS. A robust, open-source library to perform this operation is available for many, many platforms.
At the very least, studying the CMS specification might help avoid some of the many pitfalls in a home-brew implementation. See §6.1 and §6.2.1 of RFC 3369.

","
PGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and, finally, public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a user name and/or an e-mail address. The first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the X.509 system which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority  and which was added to PGP implementations later. Current versions of PGP encryption include both options through an automated key management server.

You can read the private key using the JcaPEMKeyConverter class.
The code below works for keys with and without a password:

import org.bouncycastle.openssl.PEMEncryptedKeyPair;

// reads your key file
PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new FileReader(keyFile));
Object object = pemParser.readObject();
JcaPEMKeyConverter converter = new JcaPEMKeyConverter().setProvider(""BC"");

KeyPair kp;
if (object instanceof PEMEncryptedKeyPair) {
    // Encrypted key - we will use provided password
    PEMEncryptedKeyPair ckp = (PEMEncryptedKeyPair) object;
    // uses the password to decrypt the key
    PEMDecryptorProvider decProv = new JcePEMDecryptorProviderBuilder().build(password.toCharArray());
    kp = converter.getKeyPair(ckp.decryptKeyPair(decProv));
} else {
    // Unencrypted key - no password needed
    PEMKeyPair ukp = (PEMKeyPair) object;
    kp = converter.getKeyPair(ukp);
}

// RSA
KeyFactory keyFac = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec privateKey = keyFac.getKeySpec(kp.getPrivate(), RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec.class);

System.out.println(privateKey.getClass());

The privateKey's class will be java.security.spec.RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec (which extends RSAPrivateKeySpec).

","I think the trick is to do a little bit with openssl and then get keytool to do all the real work. So with openssl convert your existing certificate and key into a PKCS12 file. Using openssl you'd have something like.
openssl pkcs12 \
  -export -in cert.crt \
  -inkey cert.key \
  -certfile ica.crt \
  -name ""yourKey"" \
  -out cert.p12

And then the magic is to import the .p12 into your keystore as if it was another keystore.
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool \
  -importkeystore -deststorepass secret \
  -destkeypass secret -destkeystore $KEYSTORE \
  -srckeystore cert.p12 \
  -srcstoretype PKCS12 \
  -srcstorepass secret \
  -alias ""yourKey""

You have options for using this within java but I would expect a full answer to involve the following.
import java.security.KeyStore;
KeyStore trustStore  = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
FileInputStream instream = new FileInputStream(new File(""/your/keystore""));
trustStore.load(instream, ""secret"".toCharArray());

Hope it works!

","Given that you don't specify an output format for your OpenSSL commands you will get a PEM-encoded file. Java will expect DER encoding. Instead of your last openssl call try:

The '-inform' parameter shouldn't be required (it seems the default), but the '-outform' probably is.
If you want to check what format you have: PEM files are ASCII (Base64 encoded), DER files are binary. If your text editor likes it, Java probably won't.

Can anybody see where I am going wrong?
","Fixed! It appears the error was a little misleading (or likely I was being stupid!) and it looks like it was NOT the plain text for encryption that was the cause of the exception but the password/passphrase.  
I found another app I was using this method in and found the KEY was the problem. I was passing a plain text password in initially, then I changed this to a SHA-256 hash of the password when this was in fact not a valid key.
I added these two methods (the later of which I found on here):
            public static string AesKeyFromPassword(string password, int keySize = Keysize.SymmetricKeyLength)
        {
            byte[] passwordByteArray = CreateKey(password);

            var aesEncryption = new RijndaelManaged
            {
                KeySize = keySize,
                BlockSize = 128,
                Mode = CipherMode.CBC,
                Padding = PaddingMode.PKCS7,
                Key = passwordByteArray
            };

            aesEncryption.GenerateIV();
            string ivStr = Convert.ToBase64String(aesEncryption.IV);
            string keyStr = Convert.ToBase64String(aesEncryption.Key);
            string completeKey = ivStr + "","" + keyStr;

            return Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(completeKey));
        }

        private static byte[] CreateKey(string password)
        {
            var salt = new byte[] { 1, 2, 23, 234, 37, 48, 134, 63, 248, 4 };

            const int Iterations = 9872;
            using (var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, Iterations))
                return rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(32);
        }

This now takes the plain text password/phrase and generates a valid encryption key which I then use in the Encrypt method.
Thank for your help guys!  I can now securely store the Private Key! :)

","My colleague has found a solution. I don't know why but using a .der file rather than a .cer file solves the problem. This is the command he used to generate the .der file using a certificate, private key and root certificate  as.pem files:

","Thanks for the accepted code above (maybe below). However, in my case, the 'getPrivatekey()' throws an InvalidKeySpecException. It says 'Unknown KeySpc type: java.secrity.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec'. The solution I used is to replace X509EncodedKeySpec with PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. Then it works!

Updated: by Marcel Roma (social msdn forums)
Most likely the certificate was installed by some other person in your company (e.g. administrator). Only that person has access to the private key of the certificate. Download the FindPrivateKey tool, ask the administrator to execute it to find out the directory where the private key file was saved, and let him set the needed rights so that the process can access the file.
There are also some reports about Windows XP failing to extract the private key from the file due to encoding issues:

","Log in as the user that installed the certificate (or a local administrator). Launch the FindPrivateKey tool. Go to security pane and add your own user to the list. You can now login in as yourself and control the certificate's private key.

But it will work fine again afterward. Now my workaround is to execute the line for 2 times. At the same time, I am also wondering if there is better way to avoid the exception.

","When this error happens and why?
Ans: When loading Android keys and storing public key from Keystore, this error may happen if the state is locked or uninitialized.
Error generating portion code is given below:
@NonNull
    public static AndroidKeyStorePublicKey loadAndroidKeyStorePublicKeyFromKeystore(
            @NonNull KeyStore keyStore, @NonNull String privateKeyAlias)
            throws UnrecoverableKeyException {
        KeyCharacteristics keyCharacteristics = new KeyCharacteristics();
        int errorCode = keyStore.getKeyCharacteristics(privateKeyAlias, null,
                null, keyCharacteristics);
        if (errorCode != KeyStore.NO_ERROR) {
            throw (UnrecoverableKeyException) new UnrecoverableKeyException(
                    ""Failed to obtain information about private key"")
                    .initCause(KeyStore.getKeyStoreException(errorCode)); // this exception is generated
        }
        ......
        ......
        ......
    }

KeyStore has 10 response code. They are
// ResponseCodes
NO_ERROR = 1;
LOCKED = 2;
UNINITIALIZED = 3;
SYSTEM_ERROR = 4;
PROTOCOL_ERROR = 5;
PERMISSION_DENIED = 6;
KEY_NOT_FOUND = 7;
VALUE_CORRUPTED = 8;
UNDEFINED_ACTION = 9;
WRONG_PASSWORD = 10;


KeyStore has 3 states. They are UNLOCKED, LOCKED, UNINITIALIZED
NO_ERROR is only happened when the state is UNLOCKED. For your
  upgrading case the state is LOCKED or UNINITIALIZED for first time, so
  the error is happened only once.

State Checking code is given below:
public State state() {
    execute('t');
    switch (mError) {
    case NO_ERROR:
        return State.UNLOCKED;
    case LOCKED:
        return State.LOCKED;
    case UNINITIALIZED:
        return State.UNINITIALIZED;
    default:
        throw new AssertionError(mError);
    }
}

UPDATE:
From your error log, it is now clear that
W/System.err﹕ Caused by: android.security.KeyStoreException: Invalid key blob

this is the main issue which is caused when user tries to UNLOCK from LOCK/UNINITIALIZED. It is by default defined as 30 secs for timing. This problem is it's API related implementation issue.
/**
 * If the user has unlocked the device Within the last this number of seconds,
 * it can be considered as an authenticator.
 */
private static final int AUTHENTICATION_DURATION_SECONDS = 30;

For encryption/decryption some data with the generated key only works if the user has just authenticated via device credentials. The error occurs from
// Try encrypting something, it will only work if the user authenticated within
// the last AUTHENTICATION_DURATION_SECONDS seconds.
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); // error is generated from here.

Actual error is thrown from here. Your error is generated from InvalidKeyException.
Solution:
You have to remove the InvalidKeyException class from the catch argument. This will still allow you to check for InvalidKeyException. After checking you have to try for second time with code so that the problem is not shown in eye but doing 2 times checking it may solve your issue. I have not tested the code but should be like below:
try {
....
KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry privateKeyEntry = (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry) this.keyStore.getEntry(""alias"", null);
....
} catch (final Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    if (e instanceof InvalidKeyException) { // bypass InvalidKeyException
        .......
        // You can again call the method and make a counter for deadlock situation or implement your own code according to your situation
        if (retry) {
            keyStore.deleteEntry(keyName);
            return getCypher(keyName, false);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}

"40599118","Provisioning profile ""XXXXXX"" doesn't include signing certificate ""iPhone Distribution: XXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXXXXXX)"".","I have been asked to update an old project done in objective-c.
I'm having this issue with my distribution provisioning profile. It goes like this

Provisioning profile ""XXXXXX"" doesn't include signing certificate
  ""iPhone Distribution: XXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXXXXXX)"".

The thing is I can see the certificate ""iPhone Distribution: XXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXXXXXX)"" in my keychain. But there are 2 of them. One has a private key and the other one doesn't and both have a different expiry date. When I checked the developer account, the distribution provisioning profile is signed with certificate that doesn't have a private key (the expiry date of the certificate shown on developer account is that of the one without private key)

What is causing this issue?
How can I fix it?
What if I can't get the private key from the older machine(as that machine is no more usable)

I tried deleting one of the certificates, and also automatically manage signing. Both didn't work.
Please help.
","
The problem is that the only valid provisioning profile you have tied to the distribution certificate for which you do not have the private key. Without the private key, it is not a valid signing identity, so Xcode won't use it.  
To fix this, You will need to create a new private key / distribution certificate, and then create a new distribution profile using the newly created certificate.  You can find instructions, starting with creating the cert signing request, here.
See 2 above.  Without the key, you can't use the existing certificate.  If you are needing to build from multiple Macs, you need to set up a sharing mechanism to provide the private key to any other Macs that will be downloading and using the certs / profiles from the Apple's site.   I would also back up the private key so that you won't run into this in the future if something happens to your build Mac.  Also, when the cert expires, it is helpful to keep the .csr file from answer 2 above.  This means you can use the same private key for the new cert when your distribution cert expires.

","I have worked through this problem.
In my case, my macOS ~/.ssh/id_rsa start with -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- which is not the proper start line.
In fact, the ssh_pkey should be started with -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----. According to the source code of sshtunnel model:
ssh_pkey (str or paramiko.PKey):
    **Private** key file name (``str``) to obtain the public key
    from or a **public** key (:class:`paramiko.pkey.PKey`)

The key is a paramiko.pkey.PKey, that means, the ~/.ssh/id_rsa should be convert to paramiko.pkey correctly.
import paramiko
pkey='~/.ssh/id_rsa'
key=paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(pkey)

# id_rsa with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`
# raise SSHException: not a valid RSA private key file

So, I generate a new key in a linux OS, with command of ssh-keygen -t rsa, then 
I authorize access to the key with ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@jump_server_host -p ssh_port.
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@jump_server_host -p ssh_port

now the ~/.ssh/id_rsa on my linux OS looks like:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAuFSEXjLMwyAJ54d5hQQjyIE+4l5pZw7GuYFDgNCzXjl6CNwV
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Copy it to my local mac, and test it. 
pkey='/path/to/the/new/id_rsa'
key=paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file(pkey) 

# id_rsa with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
# No SSHException now.

Now, it works without Exception ValueError: No password or public key available!.

        ('jump_server_host', jump_ssh_port),  # jump server
        ssh_username='username',

"7183605","Distribution certificates and private keys","Ok here is my situation: I have 2 Macbooks (lets call them #1 and #2) and I started developing on #1 in 2010.
This June 2011, my distribution certificate expired and I had to renew it. On my #1 Macbook I was able to update the certificate into the keychain and everything was fine when updating my app again.
Now, in August 2011, I wanted to update the certificate on my #2 as well and thought I just could download it from dev.apple page and add to the keychain. But when I did that, the private key below the certificate was missing! Why is that? The private key for the distribution profile for 2010 was still there visible below the (expired) certificate.
It made me so crazy that I went back to Macbook #1 and exported both of the keys there to the #2. That worked of course, but it can't be the solution for the future! What if the Macbook crashes and I want to do everything via new Macbook? Lets assume I couldn't have done the export from #1, how would I get the freakin private key below the cert in #2?
Secondly, I am a bit confused: Which keys do I need to back up? I thought it was only the private key, but I couldn't get it ""below"" the distribution certificate on my new Macbook #2, which scares me a little bit.
BTW: the certificate war with Apple is a big joke, but that's another topic.
","Once you setup your certificates, go to Xcode's Organizer and under Devices tab on the left side you will see Developer Profile section where you can export your developer profile. It's a password-protected files that will hold all your development/distribution certificates and their respective private keys, as well as any provisioning profiles you have installed. When you have this file, it's all you need to move development to new machine, just double-click it and when Xcode opens it, enter the password.
And believe it or not, ""certificate war"" is not a big joke with Apple, you should see WP7, but that's for some other place to discuss about.

","The only reason to use an external CA is so that there's a shared trust root between you and another party. If you control all the machines such as in a domain, then there's no reason at all you can't use your own CA. We have our own domain CA for Exchange. It's actually a lot easier than an external CA because the servers and clients will get the CA certs automatically.

","this article describes it pretty well:

and this one is really good too - look at the sidebar commentary:
http://www.area536.com/projects/be-your-own-certificate-authority-with-openssl/
he doesn't specifically mention SMIME email - but I think it falls under this category.
I believe that in my case ( small personal security ) being your own CA is a valid and ok way to do things - as long as you can wrap your head around the process and do it with careful understanding of the limits.
I'll still wait for someone to convince me otherwise here tho... thanks for all answers everyone is helpful!

","When people encrypt their eMail, they just want the email to be transported over the web and to be stored on the target system as an encrypted data set which only the holder of the private key can read.
Signing the email is an additional feature which should identify the sender of the email. Traditionally a signature on paper is used in the western hemisphere which is easy to fake. Therefore an attestation of the signature was required for important documents. Digital Certificate Authorites for SMIME typically attest only that the requestor had access to a certain email address, which is probably worth nothing - certainly not 20 $/year.
For me it is perfectly OK to send my private key via email or exchange it on a memory stick. What's more important is to secure your private key when you really want secure communication. Typically everyone who can get access to your PC has also access to your private key! I'm using a smart card to generate and to store the private key. The key never leaves the card. However, you have to trust the smartcard. I do trust my card because it was developed by my team. This is certainly not an option lots of people have.

","In my opinion, using a self-signed CA is an absolutely valid option. Certificates issued by this CA and used for e-mail encryption work the same way as if they were issued from a globally trusted CA with the one exception that the end user must manually trust the CA once.
This means that the crucial step is to trust the self-signed CA. However, you can make sure that the self-signed CA is correct, this step is even safer than relying on a global trust company which you must trust but do not have the choice to.
For example, we publish our public CA certificate on the web, asking others who we would like to exchange encrypted mail with to download, import and trust it. It is easy to make sure that they did not get a forged certificate by checking the certificate's finger print with us. 
Once they have trusted our CA, encrypted e-mail exchange is no difference to using a commercial, ""professional"" (intermediate) certificate.

","WinSCP supports command-line conversion of private keys from the OpenSSH (or ssh.com) format to the PuTTY .ppk format.
Use the /keygen switch:
winscp.com /keygen mykey.pem /output=mykey.ppk

(I'm the author of WinSCP)

Or, you can compile/run Unix command-line puttygen using Cygwin.

Or build your own tool from PuTTY code, it's open-source. It is rather easy (that's basically what WinSCP does).
Use import_ssh2 to load the .pem:
ssh2_userkey *import_ssh2(const Filename *filename, int type,
                          char *passphrase, const char **errmsg_p);

Use ssh2_save_userkey to save it as .ppk:

"15823094","RSA - bouncycastle PEMReader returning PEMKeyPair instead of AsymmetricCipherKeyPair for reading private key","I have a function that successfully reads a openssl formatted private key:
static AsymmetricKeyParameter readPrivateKey(string privateKeyFileName)
{
    AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyPair;

    using (var reader = File.OpenText(privateKeyFileName))
        keyPair = (AsymmetricCipherKeyPair)new PemReader(reader).ReadObject();

    return keyPair.Private;
}

and returns an AsymmetricKeyParameter which is then used to decrypt an encrypted text.
Below is the decrypt code:
public static byte[] Decrypt3(byte[] data, string pemFilename)
{
    string result = """";
    try {
        AsymmetricKeyParameter key = readPrivateKey(pemFilename);

        RsaEngine e = new RsaEngine();

        e.Init(false, key);

        //Debug.Log (encryptedMsg);

        byte[] cipheredBytes = e.ProcessBlock(data, 0, data.Length);
        //result = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(cipheredBytes);
        //return result;

    } catch (Exception e) {
        Debug.Log (""Exception in Decrypt3: "" + e.Message);
        return GetBytes(e.Message);
    }
}

These work in C# using bouncy castle library and I get the correct decrypted text. However, when I added this to Java, the PEMParser.readObject() returns an object of type PEMKeyPair instead of AsymmetricCipherKeyPair and java throws an exception trying to cast it. I checked in C# and it is actually returning AsymmetricCipherKeyPair. 
I don't know why Java behaves differently but I hope someone here can help how to cast this object or read the privatekey file and decrypt successfully. I used the same public and privatekey files in both C# and Java code so I don't think the error is from them.
Here for reference the Java version of how I'm reading the privatekey:
public static String readPrivateKey3(String pemFilename) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException
{
    AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keyParam = null;
    AsymmetricKeyParameter keyPair = null;
    PEMKeyPair kp = null;
    //PrivateKeyInfo pi = null;

    try {
        //var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenText(pemFilename);
        String absolutePath = """";
        absolutePath = Encryption.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath();
        absolutePath = absolutePath.substring(0, (absolutePath.lastIndexOf(""/"")+1));
        String filePath = """";
        filePath = absolutePath + pemFilename;

        File f = new File(filePath);
        //return filePath;

        FileReader fileReader  = new FileReader(f);
        PEMParser r = new PEMParser(fileReader);

        keyParam = (AsymmetricCipherKeyPair) r.readObject();

        return keyParam.toString();

    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        return ""hello: "" + e.getMessage() + e.getLocalizedMessage() + e.toString();
        //return e.toString();
        //return pi;
    }
}

","The Java code has been updated to a new API, which is yet to be ported across to C#. You could try the equivalent (but now deprecated) Java PEMReader class. It will return a JCE KeyPair though (part of the reason for the change was because the original version worked only with JCE types, not BC lightweight classes).
If using PEMParser, and you get back a PEMKeyPair, you can use org.bouncycastle.openssl.jcajce.JcaPEMKeyConverter.getKeyPair to get a JCE KeyPair from it. Ideally there would be a BCPEMKeyConverter, but it doesn't appear to have been written yet. In any case, it should be easy to make an AsymmetricCipherKeyPair:
PEMKeyPair kp = ...;
AsymmetricKeyParameter privKey = PrivateKeyFactory.createKey(kp.getPrivateKeyInfo());
AsymmetricKeyParameter pubKey = PublicKeyFactory.createKey(kp.getPublicKeyInfo());
new AsymmetricCipherKeyPair(pubKey, privKey);

Those factory classes are in the org.bouncycastle.crypto.util package.

","I have exactly the same issue when programatically importing a pfx file into the windows certificate store and then attempting to read this certificate and key again later.

Earlier in the document it also states: ""Note that keys produced by the SunMSCAPI provider are wrapper objects for the native handles. Thus, they may not be accepted by other providers and may behave somewhat differently than keys produced by pure-Java providers, such as SunJCE. In particular, the RSA private keys generated by the SunMSCAPI provider cannot be serialised"". Upon trying to read the private key results in null algorithm and null encoded data as you note above, though reading the certificate works fine. Alternatively you could save the PrivateKey in a separate RSA encrypted file instead of the windows certificate store or just work of the original pfx file instead of importing the pfx into the windows certificate store.

","I'm afraid you might be out of luck:

When you launch an instance, you should specify the name of the key
  pair you plan to use to connect to the instance. If you don't specify
  the name of an existing key pair when you launch an instance, you
  won't be able to connect to the instance. When you connect to the
  instance, you must specify the private key that corresponds to the key
  pair you specified when you launched the instance. Amazon EC2 doesn't
  keep a copy of your private key; therefore, if you lose a private key,
  there is no way to recover it. If you lose the private key for an
  instance store-backed instance, you can't access the instance; you
  should terminate the instance and launch another instance using a new
  key pair. If you lose the private key for an EBS-backed Linux
  instance, you can regain access to your instance. For more
  information, see Connecting to Your Linux Instance if You Lose Your

","Yes, you can't recover the old key. Still, you can generate a new key to access that machine
When we loose private key, You can't login to that machine.
Please follow the below steps to recover the key.
Step 1) Detach your root volume from your machine using AWS console.
Step 2) Launch a fresh EC2 instance(Not from your old machine AMI)
Step 3) Attach your old volume to new EC2 machine
Step 4) Now login to new ec2 machine and mount the old EBS volume
Step 5) Now go to that partition then visit home directory inside that machine and go to .ssh folder.
Step 6) Now generate a new private and public key. Then paste public key into authorized_keys file.
Step 7) Once you done with above steps, detach that volume from this ec2 machine.
Step 8) Now attach this volume to your old machine as root volume
Step 9) Now try to login to your old machine with the newly generated key.

I am able to add the private key to the keychain using ""SecKeychainItemImport"" method of ""Security.framework"" but having issues retrieving back the private key from the keychain. I have tried using ""SecKeychainItemCopyAttributesAndData"" and ""SecKeychainItemCopyContent"" methods for getting private key back from the keychain. But no luck so far. 
I have also read in blogs mentioning private key storage inside "".ssh"" hidden folder. But I feel that storing the private key inside the keychain provides one more level of security so that someone else can not have an easy access to the private key.
","One purpose of the Keychain is to keep private keys protected by not exposing their data to the application. To prevent accidentally exposing a private key, these items are flagged CSSM_KEYATTR_EXTRACTABLE | CSSM_KEYATTR_SENSITIVE by default; i.e., it is only possible to get their data using SecKeychainItemExport, and only in a passphrase-protected format.
There are APIs in the Security framework that encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify etc. data using a supplied key item without ever putting the raw key data in the application's address space. (These operations are normally done by a separate, privileged process.)
If for some reason you do need access to the private key's raw bits, you need to prepare for this at the time you import the private key to the keychain. You need to set keyAttributes to CSSM_KEYATTR_EXTRACTABLE (i.e., without the sensitive bit) in the keyParams parameter of SecKeychainItemImport.

I have a .pem file (base64-encoded cryptography information). What OpenSSL command-line should I use to detect whether it contains a public key or a private key?

In general, you have to inspect the the first line of the PEM file to determine what is present.
OpenSSL can detect a subset of available encoded things (for lack of a better term). You can see the list of what OpenSSL can decode by examining <openssl src>/crypto/pem/pem.h. From the file:
#define PEM_STRING_X509_OLD ""X509 CERTIFICATE""
#define PEM_STRING_X509     ""CERTIFICATE""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_PAIR    ""CERTIFICATE PAIR""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_TRUSTED ""TRUSTED CERTIFICATE""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_REQ_OLD ""NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_REQ ""CERTIFICATE REQUEST""
#define PEM_STRING_X509_CRL ""X509 CRL""
#define PEM_STRING_EVP_PKEY ""ANY PRIVATE KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_PUBLIC   ""PUBLIC KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_RSA      ""RSA PRIVATE KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_RSA_PUBLIC   ""RSA PUBLIC KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_DSA      ""DSA PRIVATE KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_DSA_PUBLIC   ""DSA PUBLIC KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_PKCS7    ""PKCS7""
#define PEM_STRING_PKCS7_SIGNED ""PKCS #7 SIGNED DATA""
#define PEM_STRING_PKCS8    ""ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_PKCS8INF ""PRIVATE KEY""

#define PEM_STRING_ECPARAMETERS ""EC PARAMETERS""
#define PEM_STRING_ECPRIVATEKEY ""EC PRIVATE KEY""
#define PEM_STRING_PARAMETERS   ""PARAMETERS""
#define PEM_STRING_CMS      ""CMS""

Some things will be more difficult than others. For example, its obvious what a RSA PUBLIC KEY is, but its not so obvious what a PUBLIC KEY is. In this case, you do one of two things. First, you ASN.1/DER decode the thing and then look ups its OID if available. Second, you try and load into a data structure that you expect the thing to be.
As an example of the second strategy, you would attempt to load a PEM blob into a RSA private key with PEM_read_bio_RSAPrivateKey. If it succeeds, then its a RSA private key. If its fails, then it may be a damaged RSA private key, or it may be an EC private key, or it may not be a PEM blob.

In 2006, a request was made to standardize the names of the things with the PKIX working group. It fell on deaf ears within the IETF. See PEM file format rfc draft request.

","On a different note, if there is one default account you usually use to pull/push, and you  occasionally push in changes to your other accounts, you can add a remote referring to the https url for other account to your .git/config file, though that ways you will have to enter your github passwords everytime and only the default github account (corresponding to which keys are enabled) will use ssh keys.
Something like the following
[remote ""origin""]
    url = git@github.org:account1/repository.git 
    #This one uses the default ssh keys

[remote ""account2""]
    url = https://github.com/account2/repository.git 
    #This will need password while pushing/pulling
[remote ""account3""]
    url = https://github.com/account3/repository.git 
    #This will need password while pushing/pulling

Then for normal operation, you can push/pull using ssh keys
git pull origin branch_name
git push origin branch_name

And for pushing to the other account repos, you can push via https with password
git push account2 branch_name
git push account3 branch_name

  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/work

Host personal
  HostName bitbucket.org
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal

And then in my project's local git config, I changed the host part of the remote URL to the appropriate host. For example, in the following file:
# ~/repos/myworkproject/.git/config
# or you can access this file by going into the repo and running `git config -e`

","Typically keeping a private key unencrypted is considered a bad practice in terms of security.

","A ""shared private key"" is refered to as a symmetric key. The standard symmetric algorithm in use today is AES. I have no idea if php, or flash, have the capability of using AES (Google does), but if they do, you could hard code an AES key in your code and use it to encrypt and decrypt data. However, hard coding a key is very bad cryptography and is little more than obfuscation.
Another thing to keep in mind is the cipher mode you are using. Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) requires the use of an initialization vector (sort of like a salt for a hash), so two of the same values encrypted with the same key, but different IV, will result in differen cipher text. ECB does not need an initialization vector, but is less secure. For your needs I would go with ECB so you dont have to worry about an IV.
Google is a very good way of finding information, you should use it.

"43837362","KeyVault generated certificate with exportable private key","I'm attempting to create a self signed certificate in KeyVault using the ""Self"" issuer.
$policy = New-AzureKeyVaultCertificatePolicy -SubjectName ""CN=$($certificateName)"" -IssuerName ""Self"" -ValidityInMonths 12 

$policy.Exportable = $true

Add-AzureKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certificateName -CertificatePolicy $policy

However, when getting the certificate back it doesn't appear to have a private key.
Creating certificates directly in KeyVault doesn't seem hugely covered online, after digging into the rest API documentation and source code for the powershell cmdlets, I'm stumped.
I'm hoping it's something simple I've missed, as I wish to avoid creating the certificate locally..
","If you'd like to retrieve your certificate along with its private key, then you can export it to a PFX file (with an empty password) on your disk via:
$vaultName = ""my-vault-name""
$certificateName = ""my-cert-name""
$pfxPath = [Environment]::GetFolderPath(""Desktop"") + ""\$certificateName.pfx""

$pfxSecret = Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certificateName
$pfxUnprotectedBytes = [Convert]::FromBase64String($pfxSecret.SecretValueText)
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($pfxPath, $pfxUnprotectedBytes)

If you'd like to view just the private key itself in-memory without writing to disk, then try:
$vaultName = ""my-vault-name""
$certificateName = ""my-cert-name""
$pfxPath = [Environment]::GetFolderPath(""Desktop"") + ""\$certificateName.pfx""

$pfxSecret = Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certificateName

$pfx.Import($pfxUnprotectedBytes, $null, [Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::Exportable)
$pfx.PrivateKey.ExportParameters($true)

which will show the private parameters in addition to the exponent and modulus.
If you'd like to protect the PFX file on disk with your own password (as per the ""Retrieve pfx file & add password back"" instructions in this blog post), then try:

As mentioned in the REST API docs here and here, Azure Key Vault (AKV) represents a given X.509 certificate via three interrelated resources: an AKV-certificate, an AKV-key, and an AKV-secret. All three will share the same name and the same version - to verify this, examine the Id, KeyId, and SecretId properties in the response from Get-AzureKeyVaultCertificate.
Each of these 3 resources provide a different perspective for viewing a given X.509 cert:

The AKV-certificate provides the public key and cert metadata of the X.509 certificate. It contains the public key's modulus and exponent (n and e), as well as other cert metadata (thumbprint, expiry date, subject name, and so on). In PowerShell, you can obtain this via:

(Get-AzureKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certificateName).Certificate


The AKV-key provides the private key of the X.509 certificate. It can be useful for performing cryptographic operations such as signing if the corresponding certificate was marked as non-exportable. In PowerShell, you can only obtain the public portion of this private key via:

(Get-AzureKeyVaultKey -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certificateName).Key


The AKV-secret provides a way to export the full X.509 certificate, including its private key (if its policy allows for private key exporting). As demonstrated above, the current base64-encoded certificate can be obtained in PowerShell via:

(Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $vaultName -Name $certificateName).SecretValueText

","As with any backend server, you have to guard against potentially malicious clients.
  Parse has several levels of security to help you with that.
The first step is ACLs, as you said.  You can also change permissions in the Data Browser to disable unauthorized clients from making new classes or adding rows or columns to existing classes.
If that level of security doesn't satisfy you, you can proxy your data access through Cloud Functions.  This is like creating a virtual application server to provide a layer of access control between your clients and your backend data store.

a. Create a secondary object which contains a subset of the secure objects fields.

c. Make the secondary object public read
d. Write a trigger to keep the secondary object synchronised with updates to the primary.
I also use cloud functions most of the time but this technique is useful when you need some flexibility and may be simpler than cloud functions if the secondary object is a view over multiple secure objects.

","Just keep a tight control on your Global Level Security options (client class creation, etc...), Class Level Security options (you can for instance, disable clients deleting _Installation entries. It's also common to disable user field creation for all classes.), and most important of all, look out for the ACLs.
Usually I use beforeSave triggers to make sure the ACLs are always correct. So, for instance, _User objects are where the recovery email is located. We don't want other users to be able to see each other's recovery emails, so all objects in the _User class must have read and write set to the user only (with public read false and public write false).
This way only the user itself can tamper with their own row. Other users won't even notice this row exists in your database.
One way to limit this further in some situations, is to use cloud functions. Let's say one user can send a message to another user. You may implement this as a new class Message, with the content of the message, and pointers to the user who sent the message and to the user who will receive the message.
Since the user who sent the message must be able to cancel it, and since the user who received the message must be able to receive it, both need to be able to read this row (so the ACL must have read permissions for both of them). However, we don't want either of them to tamper with the contents of the message.
So you have two alternatives: either you create a beforeSave trigger that checks if the modifications the users are trying to make to this row are valid before committing them, or you set the ACL of the message so that nobody has write permissions, and you create cloud functions that validates the user, and then modifies the message using the master key.
Point is, you have to make these considerations for every part of your application. As far as I know, there's no way around this.

","This is a tricky bootstrapping problem. Some options:

Have your app prompt the user to unlock the keystore (not very friendly, but possible)
Store the password in an owner read only file (0400 ) and use that to unlock the keystore.  The attacker has to break into your server to read the file. This seems to be the most widely used technique
Use an HSM

"16426535","What is a private key in Android?","I read this article about signing your Android applications. I used Eclipse to export my Android application, had to create a keystore (which succeeded) and a private key with an alias (which also succeeded). So I know that I have to sign the application with a private key.
However, the article does not make clear anything on the following questions:

What is a private key?
Should each application you make have another key or should they share the same private key?
What is an alias?
Why do the applications have a validity lifetime?

","Signing is like a certificate for your Android application (think web certificates to have some idea) - it proves that you're the owner of that application. Every app must be signed, as the link you provided clearly says.
In theory, every application from a developer should be under the same signature (after all, it's >your< signature, not the app's)
The alias is just that: an alias for your key, which you use to refer to the keystore when signing the application.
And about the lifespan, not everything lasts forever. Those signatures (or certificates if you will) can last over 25 years. Not something you have to worry about.

","A private key is a cryptographic tool that verifies you are the owner of the app. Any build that is being updated to the Google Play store must be signed by your private key to prove it is a legitimate build.
So each different application that you want to upload to the store should have its own private key. If you ever lose this key, you will not be able to upload any new versions of your app, so make sure to store it somewhere safe and make backups! 
However, you can store multiple private keys in the same keystore for convenience. (Although I do not, I find it more convenient to have a different keystore for every project as well.)
An alias is simply an easy to read name for the key. Nothing more or less.
It's worth noting, when you do an Eclipse ""Run"", it uses something called the debug key to run the application. This works fine because you are not trying to upload this build to the store, but this is why you need to use a separate build process to build your application for deployment.
The lifetime validity is a technical requirement. Just set it way in the future and don't worry about it.

I have created several certificates + provisioning profiles successfully in the past but this one seems to be putting up a fight.
This particular key was used for my old team provisioning profile but the certificate expired so I am trying to create a new certificate.
Thanks   
","I found an alternative way of submitting requests:
Revoke certificates in provisioning centre, delete profile from xcode. Then hit refresh in organizer in xcode, xcode will submit the request for you and do its stuff.
I was also missing a public key from the keychain which it generated.

It also needs the reCAPTCHA keys depending on the website. What's the reason behind this? Does the Public and Private key affect the words displayed in the reCAPTCHA? I know that I can set the Public and Private key to be GLOBAL in which it can be used for other domains but why even need the keys in the first place?
","OK. This is my guess, no guarantee.

Your public key is required while generating client-side page.
The client uses this public key to request from recaptcha: an image, a corresponding correct answer and perhaps an id. Of course the answer and the id comes encrypted, using the public key. (So the client cannot know the answer)
User types in the answer, sends it to your server.
You have: {id, answer} encrypted using public key. You send your private key and this encrypted message to recaptcha server.
recaptcha unencrypts the message, revealing the answer and id, and checks if they match.
it tells your server the result of the check.

Note:

If the user sends a public key of his own to recaptcha, the check won't succeed since your private key does not work with his public key.
The scheme proves that your server is really the one receiving the recaptcha answer.

Actually we need to generate our own private key either with pass-phrase or without pass-phrase. Then we can login server using own private key.
Steps to generate private key in this url
https://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/32883-how-can-i-use-private-keys-for-my-ssh-sensors-with-prtg
After generating private key, we can do ssh login or stp using :
sftp  -oIdentityFile=<generated_private_key>  <user>@<ftp_server>:<remote_directory>

ssh -i <generated_private_key>  <user>@<ftp_server>

we can use importance stp_command for automation task: 
http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/104/fall05/ordonez/sftp_cmds.shtml
Now i can write shell script after login and listing file on Remote FTP server. if anything confusion. pls comment.

$privKey = openssl_pkey_get_private($rsaKey);

Both are PEM format, but the second is a RSA private key. With the second, PHP can login. So I need a key that starts with RSA PRIVATE KEY, not just PRIVATE KEY. How can I create this with PHP and OpenSSL PHP implementation?
","So, these are two different key types. You're looking for PKCS #1, but getting PKCS #8.
This appears to be related to the version of OpenSSL that PHP uses. Versions since 1.0 create a PKCS #8 file, and there's nothing the PHP developers want to do about it. The same issue arises when doing it from the command line with this command:
openssl req -new -keyout mykey.key -out mycertreq.csr -nodes -sha1 -newkey rsa:2048

You can try using an external library called phpseclib, though I haven't tried it myself:
<?php
include('Crypt/RSA.php');

$rsa = new Crypt_RSA();
$rsa->setPublicKeyFormat(CRYPT_RSA_PUBLIC_FORMAT_OPENSSH);
$result = $rsa->createKey();

"50227580","Create X509Certificate2 from PEM file in .NET Core","I want to create a X509Certificate2 object based on a PEM file. The problem is setting the PrivateKey property of X509Certificate2. I read X509Certificate2.CreateFromCertFile() on .NET Core
 and then used
var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();

rsa.ImportCspBlob(pvk);

Where pvk is the byte array of the private key (read from GetBytesFromPEM as shown here how to get private key from PEM file?), to set the private key, but then I get an 

Internal.Cryptography.CryptoThrowHelper+WindowsCryptographicException with message Bad Version of provider. 

How can I properly set the PrivateKey of the X509Certificate2 based on the private key in the PEM file?
If I look at Creating the X509Certificate2, they use 
 RSACryptoServiceProvider prov = Crypto.DecodeRsaPrivateKey(keyBuffer);
 certificate.PrivateKey = prov;

which seems like a neat way to do this, but this does not work in .Net Core...
","If you've just extracted the bytes from the Base64 encoding of the private key file you have a PKCS#1, PKCS#8, or encrypted PKCS#8 private key blob (depending on if it said ""BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"", ""BEGIN PRIVATE KEY"" or ""BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY"").  ImportCspBlob wants a custom format for the data, and that's why it's complaining.
Digital signature in c# without using BouncyCastle has an explanation of ways forward.  The easiest / most formulaic is to just make a PFX with the cert and key, and let the X509Certificate2 constructor do its thing.
If you go the route of loading the key object directly then the way you would mate a private key with the certificate is to use one of the new CopyWithPrivateKey extension methods.  This returns a new instance of X509Certificate2 which knows about the private key.
The PrivateKey setter was ""removed"" from .NET Core because it has a lot of side effects on Windows that are hard to replicate on Linux and macOS, particularly if you retrieved the certificate out of an instance of X509Store.

This code is a combination of overly strict and overly accepting for real BER rules, but this should read validly encoded PKCS#8 files unless they included attributes.

","As mentioned in the comments, you want to keep you private key private, or everyone is able to login into your secure service. (Hence the name private key)
The only way to keep it really private is to not pass it around to others. For example, one your provide the private key using the UI of the application. If this key is not present, the user is unable to access the service!
This seems impossible in your current situation, at least from what it understand of your question. So a second best solution is to password protect the key. But then you need to provide the password to your users, which is fairly the same as providing the key itself to your users (previous option)...
The worse option is to embed the key into your application/APK without it being password protected. Any adept user is able to retrieve the key, using the same algorithm as the application uses: Deobfuscation, downloading, reading a file, etc.
The conclude, it seems silly that your service requires a private key, and your pass the key to (all? of) your users. So everyone is able to connect to the service... Why do you need the private key to access the service?
In the end the choice of the method to provide the key is yours!

UPDATE (was too long for a comment)
The general idea when using keys is, that the client has a (custom generated) private/public key-pair. next, the public key part is send to the service. And the client is able to authenticate using the private key (by proving that the client has indeed the private key part).
In your situation, you need to provide a method to send public keys to your storage/service. The problem is that you need to somehow verify that the public key belongs to a client you want to grant access. This could be manually verified by administrators... Otherwise anyone is still able create nonsense subscriptions.
To be more concrete for your own application. It could include a SSL public/private key-pair  generator. After a new key-pair is generated, the public key could be send to your service from the application.
The service need to get it authenticated, until that moment the client could connect to the service (using the non-authenticated key-pair) to a read-only (guest) subscription (for example).
Again, the choice of the actual implementation is yours, these are only pointers.

I'm on OS X an I do have openSSL installed (if needed I can also use Ubuntu or Windows though), and was able to view the attributes and issuer/subject using openssl req -noout -text -in file.p10 but I'm not sure where to go from here. 
I need these files for pybankid. 
","You need to complete a few more steps in order to get what you need. 
Let me explain the complete process to create a certificate:

Generate a key (with or without a pass phrase).
Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using your key.
Send your CSR to the Certificate Authority (CA) (in your case the partnering bank) and ask them to sign it.
Once you get the certificate from the CA, convert it to the desired format using you key.

The .p10 file you have is most likely a CSR. To verify, try:
openssl req -noout -text -in *.p10

and look for something like:
Certificate Request:
Data:
    Version: 0 (0x0)...

You have a pass phrase, but it's not clear to me if you have access to the key used to generate the CSR, make sure you do before you send your request to the CA (step 3). Otherwise you will not be able to use the singed certificate.
Once you have a signed certificate (something like cert.crt), you can see the details using this command:
openssl x509 -text -in cert.crt -noout

Now you are ready for the final step (4).
To generate a .pfx/.p12 file, use:
openssl pkcs12 -inkey *.key -in *.crt -export -out certificate.pfx

to then convert certificate.pfx to .pem (including bag attributes), use:
openssl pkcs12 -in *.pfx -out cert.pem -nodes

After some debugging, i understand that its an issue with \n characters. If i read from a file the private key contains \n characters. But if i read from .yaml file, it does not have \n characters. I replaced all new lines into \n characters and converted it into single line. Still it's not working.
How can i provide this value in application.yaml which is equivalent to reading from that file?

How can I convert this back to a private key object in Java? I have tried converting this string back to a byte array but I'm clueless as to how I should continue.
This is how I converted my private key to a hex string:
public static String getHexString(byte[] b){
  String result = """";
  for (int i = 0; i < b.length; i++){
    result += Integer.toString((b[i] & 0xff) + 0x100, 16).substring(1);
   }
   return result;
 }

I then used the getEncoded() method on my private key as input for this method.
","When you call getEncoded() on an RSA private key, most providers will return the private key in PKCS #8 format. This is the case with your example.
To reverse the process, use a KeyFactory with a PKCS8EncodedKeySpec as follows:
String key = ""30820278020...1608""; // omitted for brevity

byte[] keyData = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(key);
KeyFactory factory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
RSAPrivateKey privateKey = (RSAPrivateKey) factory
    .generatePrivate(new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(keyData));

Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(""SHA512withRSA"");
signature.initSign(privateKey);
signature.update(""Hello, World"".getBytes());
System.out.println(DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(signature.sign()));

I am writing a script that logs in to the server and downloads file.
I do not want to store account password in the script. Is there anyway I can login to server with some-kind of host-key or private-key or something.
","Yes, you can use the public key authentication. But for that you still have to store the private key along with your script. Normally the key is encrypted with a passphrase. To automate the login, you would have to store the passphrase to the script file anyway (using the -passphrase switch). So still, if anyone gets an access to your machine, he/she is still able to steal your identity, just as with the password. Though there's an advantage. You can have multiple keys (while only one password). If you use a special key for the script and the key is ever compromised, you can revoke it, while keeping the other keys.
Note that, if you are not absolutely sure of the physical and electronic security of the system on which you are connecting, there's hardly any way to setup an automatic authentication. If you are sure about the security, storing password in the script file is just ok.  
Anyway, your question is mostly duplicate of:
How do I setup Public-Key Authentication?
For WinSCP specifics, see the guide to Setting up SSH public key authentication.
See also the WinSCP guide to Protecting credentials used for automation.

","I had a similar issue on windows so I used Putty instead http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
If you need to generate a public key then use: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe
I gave the public key + password to whoever owned the SFTP server to install it on his side.
I saved the private key on my side lest say on ""C:\privatekey.ppk""
You don't use password on your script but you link to the private which you must have on you machine.
Then, when you want to automate a batch to download from the FTP server the Pageant in order to load the private key into session http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pageant.exe
Then use the PSFTP to connect and perform actions http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/psftp.exe
So here is sample code for the batch file:
!--Loading the key to session--!
@C:\pageant.exe ""C:\privatekey.ppk""
!--Calling the PSFTP.exe with the uaser and sftp address + command list file--!
@C:\psftp user@your.server.address -b C:\sftp_cmd.txt

Command list file (sftp_cmd.txt) will like like this:
mget ""*.*"" !--downloading every thing
!--more commands can follow here

"27743045","EC private key recovery from PEM format with BouncyCastle","My application stores private keys in PEM format, the existing code works for RSA keys but I am trying to switch to EC keys and there is a problem. The key recovery seems to work, and the equals method on the recovered key returns true for the original key, but getAlgorithm() on the original key returns ""EC"" and on the recovered key ""ECDSA"". The discrepancy in the algorithm later causes problems because it does not match the algorithm for the corresponding public key.

recoveredKey.getAlgorithm()=ECDSA

Key recovery ok
Key algorithms do not match

","The problem is not the PEMParser but JcaPEMKeyConverter which treats EC keys as keys for ECDSA:
algorithms.put(X9ObjectIdentifiers.id_ecPublicKey, ""ECDSA"");
...
private KeyFactory getKeyFactory(AlgorithmIdentifier algId)
throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchProviderException
{
  ASN1ObjectIdentifier algorithm = algId.getAlgorithm();
  String algName = (String)algorithms.get(algorithm);
...

The algorithm identifier is id-ecPublicKey, which is also used for ECDSA keys, so the algorithm selection is not unique here and probably the BC devs have chosen ECDSA as the most suitable choice. You could do something similar like JcaPEMKeyConverter with you own KeyFactory but choose your correct algorithm for EC keys.

How do I fix this problem? I have been trying to work it out for so long but now am just totally stuck.

","
You must to know two things: private key can be created is putty and openssh-compatible formats - and these formats are not freely exchangeable (client-side tool can understand putty or openssh only), Linux understand only openssh-type keys
You must use on client-side (additional) tool, which provide non-interactive authentication by key on request

A consequence of points 1 and 2
Windows-client: run pageant, load putty's private key into it (enter passphrase for key). Maybe you have to redefine in Git ssh-client from system to plink
Linux-client: on Windows-host load putty-type private key into puttygen and export into openssh-key. Save this file in Linux-box as /.ssh/id_dsa. Run ssh-agent, enter password once. ssh-agent will use password for key for all requests during session

","Some machines have a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and some also have a keychain or keystore that leverages the TPM. Macs do as do some Windows machines. Just encryption a key moves the problem to securing the encryption key.
When you get code look to see if it is current, old bad code is rarely removed from the Internet. The MDN code is completely out of date in every respect.
Do not use DES, it is no longer consider secure and 3DES is archaic and not recommended for new work. Instead use AES. DES, 3DES and AES are all symmetric keys.
Do not use MD5, it is no longer considered secure, use at least SHA256 but for password derivation use a method that uses a salt and iteration count such as PBKDF2 (Password Based Derivation Function 2).
Do not use ECB mode, it too is insecure, see ECB mode, scroll down to the Penguin.

","You can have a look at another answer of mine:

Where to store db passwords when using Windows .NET or ASP.NET applications

Or you can consider generating a key from a password, which you can use to encrypt the key itself:

Create a Key from a Password / Random SALT (in C#)

Either way, you should not use DES any longer as it is not secure enough any more. Triple-DES is okay if you have no other option. I recommend to use AES with a key size of 256 bit if you require a secure symmetric algorithm.

This example is taken from MSDN.
It is a console demo, and it shows how to create a secure key based on a user-defined password, and how to create a random SALT based on the cryptographic random generator.
Notes:

The built-in function PasswordDeriveBytes uses the standard PBKDF1 algorithm to generate a key from the password. Per default, it uses 100 iterations to generate the key to slow down brute force attacks. The SALT generated randomly further strenghens the key.
The function CryptDeriveKey converts the key generated by PasswordDeriveBytes into a key compatible with the specified encryption algorithm (here ""TripleDES"") by using the specified hash algorithm (here ""SHA1""). The keysize in this example is 192 bytes, and the initialization vector IV is taken from the triple-DES crypto provider
Usually, this mechanism is used to protect a stronger random generated key by a password, which encrypts large amount of data. You can also use it to provide multiple passwords of different users to give access to the same data (being protected by a different random key).
Unfortunately, CryptDeriveKey does currently not support AES. See here. 
NOTE: As a workaround, you can create a random AES key for encryption of the data to be protected with AES and store the AES key in a TripleDES-Container which uses the key generated by CryptDeriveKey. But that limits the security to TripleDES, does not take advantage of the larger keysizes of AES and creates a dependency to TripleDES.

I want to avoid explicit path to key storage and storage password in my application source code.
","Check out the IBM KeySetHelper API. 
First, define a KeyStore in WAS admin. This is what will reference the key database (JKS, PKCS12, etc) on the filesystem via path.  Then define a named KeySet and reference the KeyStore. Create an alias in the key set that matches a label in the KeyStore. This limits access to specific keys if you have several in the store.  
You can then ""lookup"" the named keystore via KeySetHelper by name.  Note: you'll need to know what type of key is in the store.  You won't need to know labels within the key database (or even passwords) in your code.  However, you'll need to know whether or not the key is a shared secret (in which case you'll receive a java.security.SecretKey implementation.  Since you want a java.security.PrivateKey, make sure you load a personal certificate into the key database that is represented in WAS as your keystore.
If you manually load a certificate into your keydatabase backing your keystore, you can leave off the key generator class name parameter of the keyset.  That's used if you want to have WAS generate keys.  If you also need a java.security.PublicKey, be sure to check the ""generates key pair"" option.  In that case, you are returned from your KeySetHelper::getLatestKeysForKeySet call a com.ibm.websphere.crypto.KeyPair which contains both a java.security.PrivateKey and a java.security.PublicKey (plus access to a java.security.Certificate).

"25725956","Export Token Signing certificate private key from ADFS","I am implementing a SSO mechanism with a Service Provider (SP) by using ADFS as Identity Provider (idp).
The SP regular website offers integration with ADFS so it was enough to setup the SP as Relying Partner in my ADFS and provide them the Token Signing certificate. 
The mobile app of the SP does not offer integration with ADFS, therefore they require a web application to be built (SSOApplication) that bridges the SSO mechanism between SP and ADFS. The SP redirects the request to SSOApplication that in the background, by using SAML, queries the ADFS and then, if authentication is approved, sends the response to the SP.
SSOApplication correctly communicates with ADFS but I cannot sign the SAML response for the SP because in the Token Signing certificate, contrarely to the SSL certificate, there is no option to export the private key (although MS claims it is possible here). The SP requires the same certificate for both Web and Mobile App entry points, therefore I cannot use two different Token Signing certificates.
Moreover, this very certificate is used by other SPs that communicate with my ADFS, therefore if I change certificate I have to communicate the new certificate to the other SP integrated with our ADFS. Is there any way to export the private key from the Signing Token certificate? Is there any way to use differnet Token Signing certificates for different realying parties in ADFS?
PS: In ADFS I can export the key of the SSL certificate but there is not the same option for Token Signing. 
","The link is for ADFS 1.x. In ADFS 2.0 and above it is not possible. The official way is to create another signing cert and import in ADFS. Indeed then all SPs need to roll-over......
That is the official answer. Now the hack.
If you are using a farm with a service account, then it is in the user store of that account. But export is disabled. If you know how to work with mimikatz from gentlekiwi (and know how to read French :-) ), then you can even solve that too.

What I don't know is how to consume the password used to encrypt the private key in my Decrypt method.  Right now, without knowing how to ""decrypt"" my private key using he password, I get the following Exception:

}

","It seems to me that you need to decrypt the private key to use it. Currently your password parameter isn't used. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be all that easy to find out how do this.

Bouncy Castle, as many other Java API's, use a password handler to retrieve the password. The reason to do this is to allow the program to ask the user for the password only when it is required. This allows the program to leave the password in memory for the shortest amount of time.
So to allow for decryption, use the following constructor:
PemReader(TextReader reader, IPasswordFinder pFinder);

with an implementation of IPasswordFinder (Bouncy Castle for C# is mainly a Java port, otherwise a delegate would probably have been used).

For your convenience, the code. This code also reconstructs the entire key pair, not just the private key.
Import statements:
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Generators;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Parameters;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Prng;
using Org.BouncyCastle.OpenSsl;
using Org.BouncyCastle.Security;
using System.IO;

the decoder:
private static AsymmetricCipherKeyPair DecodePrivateKey(string encryptedPrivateKey, string password)
{
    TextReader textReader = new StringReader(encryptedPrivateKey);
    PemReader pemReader = new PemReader(textReader, new PasswordFinder(password));
    object privateKeyObject = pemReader.ReadObject();
    RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters rsaPrivatekey = (RsaPrivateCrtKeyParameters)privateKeyObject;
    RsaKeyParameters rsaPublicKey = new RsaKeyParameters(false, rsaPrivatekey.Modulus, rsaPrivatekey.PublicExponent);
    AsymmetricCipherKeyPair kp = new AsymmetricCipherKeyPair(rsaPublicKey, rsaPrivatekey);
    return kp;
}

required helper class:
private class PasswordFinder : IPasswordFinder
{
    private string password;

    public PasswordFinder(string password)
    {
        this.password = password;
    }


    public char[] GetPassword()
    {
        return password.ToCharArray();
    }
}


Note that normally you should only use char[] instead of string for passwords as char[] can be cleared after use, while string cannot.
Now you have the private key decryption should be easy.

","The usual way to do this would not be (direct) asymmetric encryption, but using an encrypted (and authenticated) channel to send the data, for example using SSL/TLS.
On the server side, you simply have to configure your web server to also offer HTTPS access.
On the client side, I suppose the easiest would be to use an HTTPS URL to send the data:
URL url = new URL(""https://example.com/myscript.php"");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(true);
OutputStream out = conn.getOutputStream();

 // write data to stream

out.close();
InputStream in = conn.getInputStream();

// read answer from input stream

in.close();

I'm not sure on how to configure the accepted server certificates for Android, though.
This will (under the hoods) use the server's RSA key (in its certificate) to authenticate the connection and negotiate a session key for symmetric encryption.

","The normal private key format for RSA includes the public key (the ""public exponent"" is useful for implementation of private key operations in a way which resists timing attacks). Therefore, it is possible to extract the public key from the private key.
(It is theoretically possible to have a ""pure RSA private key"" which does NOT include the public exponent, but it has drawbacks, such as much harder protection against side-channel attacks, and reduced performance. Therefore nobody in their right mind does that. You can assume that when you have the private key you actually have the complete key pair.)
In the C#/.NET standard library, public and private RSA keys can be represented as XML strings (ToXmlString() and FromXmlString()) or a custom RSAParameters structure (ExportParameters() and ImportParameters()). If you can obtain the complete private key then you just have to pick the public fields (modulus and public exponent), which constitute together the public key. Note that RSACryptoServiceProvider may be an interface to an underlying RSA implementation which could refuse to export the private key (but will usually accept to export the public key).

The public and private keys form a pair: each key in the pair can decrypt messages encrypted with the other, but cannot decrypt messages encrypted with itself.  If the client can decrypt a message with the public key, it knows the message was encrypted by the owner of the public key.  Conversely, a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key.
The basic idea is that the client generates a key for a symmetric-key cypher, encrypts it with the public key, and sends that to the server.  Both sides then use that symmetric key and cypher for the majority of the communication.

Isnt this the other way around? Is this current configuration incorrect --- Both the keys are same by the way.
","In SSL communication,when the client wants to interact with some server, the server sends its public key. Always remember a certificate is nothing but a public key with a bunch of supporting information. 
The problem here is any hacker can masquerade as a server and can block the communication between server and client. So the server certificate must be signed by some certificate authority. The client only believes the server certificate if it is signed by a certificate authority.In that case the hacker in between can not masquerade as a server because its certificate will not be authenticated by the certificate authority.
So client accepts the certificate and gets the public key of server. Now the client can send its public key encrypted by the public key of the server. Since this encrypted message can only be decrypted by the private key of the server so only server can decrypt it.
But the use of public key and private key over the ssl communication can slow down the connection very much because these keys lengths are 1024 or 2048 bits. 
So practically what happens is instead of sending its own public key, the client sends the symmetric key encrypted by the public key of the server. Server decrypts it with its private key and it gets to know the symmetric key. Now the further communication happens with this symmetric key encryption and decryption.Since no third party gets to know the symmetric key, the communication will be secure.
Remember symmetric key lengths are generally 64-128 unlike public keys hence less the time for encryption and decryption.

So the client trusts the content thats coming from the server using the public key.

No. There is no 'so' about it. The client trusts the server certificate because it is signed by someone he trusts, and he knows it belongs to the server because the server provides a digital signature that the client can verify, which only the private key owner can do. Therefore he knows that the server owns that public key.

How does the client encrypt the contents he is sending back to the server ?.

The client and server negotiate a shared session key independently using techniques described in RFC 2246. For the most part they don't involve PKI at all.

Using the public key of the server? or does the client send a autogenerated private key and encrypts it using the public key which is then decypted by the server along with the message and used for furthter communication by both parties.

Neither, see above. This is quite a large subject.


A Public and a Private key is required to do ssl communication.


No. One of the parties must have a private key and a corresponding certificate that the other party trusts, otherwise the communication is insecure.

This Key pair is generated using a self signed certificate

No. The statement doesn't even make sense. Key pairs are generated first, nothing to do with certificates yet. The certificate is a wrapper for the public key.

How can a single self signed certificate contain both public and private keys.

It can't, and it doesn't. Self-signing doesn't have anything to do with it either.

"40243239","Android Fingerprint API and Private/Public keys","When I enrol first and only fingerprint and generate KeyPair the PrivateKey gets invalidated when I use it for the second time. This happens only once. Am I the only one having this issue? Is there something wrong with my code?
I cannot use any other key as I'm using PrivateKey to sign data.
Steps:

Wipe all fingerprints
Enrol one fingerprint
Generate KeyPair and use FingerprintManager :: authenticate
During next use of FingerprintManager :: authenticate PrivateKey gets permanently invalidated. This happens only for the first time

Below the code where I generate the KeyPair
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""AndroidKeyStore"");
keystore.load(null);
KeyPairGenerator generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_EC, ""AndroidKeyStore"");
generator.initialize(new KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(""key_name"", KeyProperties.PURPOSE_SIGN)

    .setSignaturePaddings(paddings) // I have defined paddings before
    .setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)
    .build());
generator.generateKeyPair();

And here is the code where I invoke fingerprint authentication for data signing:
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""AndroidKeyStore"");
keyStore.load(null);
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance(""signing_algorithm"");
PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keyStore.getKey(""key_name"", null);
signature.initSign(privateKey); // Here I get KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException

FingerprintManager fingerprintManager = context.getSystemService(FingerprintManager.class);
CancellationSignal cancellationSignal = new CancellationSignal();
AuthenticationCallback authenticationCallback = new AuthenticationCallback() {
    ...
};
fingerprintManager.authenticate(crypto, cancelationSignal, 0, authenticationCallback, null);

","i try this link and work perfectly .
First you need to set Minimum sdk look like the Picture

Second set Permission in Mainfest
   <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT"" />

Third

generateKey() function which generates an encryption key which is then stored securely on the device.
cipherInit() function that initializes the cipher that will be used to create the encrypted FingerprintManager.
CryptoObject instance and various other checks before initiating the authentication process which is implemented inside onCreate() method.

","Short answer: Not with BouncyCastle.
You can't put the key into the BouncyCastle (or OpenSSL or any other) library and use it from there. There is no way to do this without circumventing the ""no export"" flag and exporting it, which as you point out is possible if you are an administrator and have the requisite Fu.
What you can do is get a CryptoAPI handle to the key, and ask CryptoAPI to do the signing or encryption operations for you. The DotNet crypto classes encapsulate CyptoAPI.
So essentially what you need is a tutorial on how to use the DotNet crypto classes. There are many, for example this MSDN Magazine article has an example of digital signatures about three quarters of the way down:

","This question is exactly what I need, but the answer has a link that is not working.
After searching for some time I found this implementation using NCrypt library:
https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/blob/master/Samples/Win7Samples/security/cryptoapi/CertSign/CPP/Sign.cpp
Unfortunately this is written in C, while I need a C# implementation. So I created this C++\CLI wrapper (SignerWrapper.h) that can be used in managed C# code:
https://github.com/DmitriNymi/StoreCertificateSigner
I also wrote a custom ISignatureFactory to be used in BouncyCastle, see PksAsn1SignatureFactory.cs in the same repo.  It is there only to have my custom ISigner to be created (my class: PksEcdsaSigner ).
Now you can pass PksAsn1SignatureFactory as ISignatureFactory to BouncyCastle for creating new certificates for example, see unit test PksAsn1SignatureFactoryTest.cs - explicit call to ISignatureFactory
and 
CertificateIssuerTest.cs - using helper class to create new certificates signed by private keys from another certificate in the store

","You could use a symmetric encryption and secret sharing scheme on top of that, ""splitting the key in half"".
More on secret sharing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing
Steps on how I see it:

Encrypt the data using (pseudo) randomly generated key.
Distribute the secret using Shamir's secret sharing which is the key to two shares, where as one share will suffice to get the key.

The end result is that one (or more) ""keys"" are required to get the data.

","Asymmetric keys are never used for encrypting messages (too slow, has a size limit, etc.), only for encrypting small buffers, like symmetric keys for messages. 
When you encrypt a message with an asymm. key, you are in fact encrypting a symmetric key which encrypts the message. 
Simply encrypt the same symmetric key with two different asymm. keys and you'd get two different cipherblocks which both contain the same symmetric key for the message, so you can decrypt with either one.

","The public key need no security, so you can save as clear text in the database.
with the private key you have different solution based on level of security and kinds of attacks you want to avoid.
1
save the pk as clear text in the db. Never write php code that echo the pk
2
save the pk in p12 format protect it with a password. You can prompt the password to the user every time you need
3
generete, store and use the pk using a HSM http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module

"13795615","Keychain Assistant does not create public/private key pair, and my distribution certificates fail codesign verification","My certificates were expiring today (and at this point, it's totally expired), so I set out to renew the certificates. But the problem is, I can't get matching private/public keys for proper code-signing verification with the renewed certificates.  All I've read says keychain will automatically create matching public/private keys, but it's not doing it for me.  I am totally stumped and I don't know what I can do at this point.  Please help.  Here's what I've done so far:
1)  I revoked the certificates from Apple Developer > iOS Provisioning Portal > Certificates > Developer and Distribution tabs.
2)  I launched Keychain Access.app from Applications > Utilities.
3)  I removed all outdated certificates, and eventually removed everything except for Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority, Dashboard Advisory and Software Signing.  (By the way, I have no idea what this ""Software Signing"" certificate is for, but it won't be expiring until 2015, I'm reluctant to delete it without knowing what it would do to the system if I deleted it.)
4)  I generated CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority
5)  Got the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest on desktop.  (At this point, I check the Keychain, and I still don't see my private or public keys.
6)  I submit the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest at Apple Developer > iOS Provisioning Portal > Certificates > Developer and Distribution tabs.
7)  I download the certificates, install them to keychain, and it looks like my certificates are now renewed for another year.
8)  I renew all provisioning profiles.
9)  I retrieve them to my Xcode.
10)  I generate new distribution build, then I get the warning that ""Application failed codesign verification.  The signature was invalid, contains disallowed entitlements, or it was not signed with an iPhone Distribution Certificate.""
11)  I look at the Keychain again, and I don't see my private or public keys. 
12)  Well, I exported p12 file a year ago.  So, okay, I start all over again (i.e., take the steps 1, 2 and 3.)  Then I import the p12 file.  Now I see my private key in my Keychain.
13)  I then resume with step 4 above (i.e., get the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest via Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority)
14)  I continue on with steps 5 through 8.  Just to make sure, I reboot my machine again.  Then I check my Keychain, and public key is still missing, and taking steps 9 and 10 results exactly the same.
What am I doing wrong?  What should I do to fix this problem?  I'd so appreciate any and all help.

EDIT:  I'm not entirely sure which steps I took actually ended up fixing this, but I got it working now. Main thing was, deleting everything from keychain and look for possible cause all over the web, and and I did read this thread too:
http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060318124936642
And run these commands:
sudo systemkeychain -vfcC
systemkeychain -vt
I also continued to look for how to repair keychain, run disk utility, repairing any and all permission issues, etc.
And eventually, my keychain access app started working as expected again, and it finally generated both private and public keys.  Ahhhh.  Once it did that, everything else worked fine, doing the steps I took earlier.

The issue I'm having is generating a public and private key pair I'm using RSACryptoServiceProvider, but I can only get the key attributes and not the complete public key.
RSACryptoServiceProvider RSA = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();
RSAParameters RSAKeyInfo = RSA.ExportParameters(false);

I'm unable to supply the micro controller with the key parameters as it only takes the key (as bytes). There is a library that will be able to do this, but it will only be available sometime in November 2012 (SW300055). I am using the SW300052 library to perform encryption on the micro-controller (key size is limited to 256 bits).
I've also tried bouncycastle suggestion in this thread (generating keys and showing them in a text box). It saves the keys in a PEM format. From what I understand the keys are saved in a base64 format. I've specified the key length to be 256 bits but when converting the public key back to bytes, it is 62 bytes.
byte[] encodedDataAsBytes = Convert.FromBase64String (publicKeyString);

I've also looked at Microsoft's Strong Name tool (sn.exe), but the minimum key size it supports is 384 bits.
Is there any way that I can generate a public private key pair and get the public key in plain text/bytes using c# (or with any other tool)? Am I just better off using symmetric key encryption to encrypt a session key?
","You can set up a certificate server on a windows box and request them directly. You'll need to install MS certificate services.
You can also use makecert and access the key with c#.
Or you could generate the keypair programmatically.

Is there any location where I can store it securely and doesn't get deleted if app re-installs.
","You can store the key in the Preferences of your App. This will protect the key from
getting read by other applications because of the underlying file system restrictions of
the Android system.

But this won't protect the key from being read by the user itself.
and if you want to use this shared preference after your application removed and again installed in device then try for Android Backup Manager.
I think its help you in re-installation of your activity's data. 
EDIT: Android (unfortunately) does not provide a way to do so. The approach I've used
      before is to encrypt this token with another key generated within the app.

      Your app key can be algorithmically generated. This, however, is only as secure as
      your algorithm. Once that is known this is equivalent to storing the token in plain text.

I am seeing that every .p12 file I run into has a X504 certificate and at least one key, and in some situations two keys. This is due to the fact that every .p12 has an Apple developer key, and some have an extra key (possibly an Apple root authorization key). I am considering only those .p12 files with two keys as valid. My goal here is to differentiate between those .p12 files that have one key and those that have two. 
So far I have used OpenSSL to be able to inspect X504 files and the keys of any .p12. For example I have this code that does the inspections for all .p12 files in a directory:
Dir.glob('*.p12').each do |p|
  file = File.read(p)
  p12 = OpenSSL::PKCS12.new(file, """")

  # note that this new certificate is in an X509 format
  cert = p12.certificate
  puts p12.inspect()
  puts cert.inspect()
end

This is my output:

#<OpenSSL::X509::Certificate subject=/UID=FFBMT4K5/CN=iPhone Distribution: A.H.

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

My question is how can I determine whether this certificate has more than one key, and also how I can inspect the keys for information. If what I am asking or my understanding of this issue is fundamentally flawed, please let me know. This is my first time being exposed to certificates and any information will be greatly helpful. Any points in the right direction will be appreciated, thanks in advance. 
EDIT:
Using OpenSSL I can view the two shrouded keybags of a .p12. Example:
openssl pkcs12 -in some_p12.p12 -info -noout

output:
Enter Import Password:
MAC Iteration 1
MAC verified OK
PKCS7 Encrypted data: pbeWithSHA1And40BitRC2-CBC, Iteration 2048
Certificate bag
Certificate bag
PKCS7 Data
Shrouded Keybag: pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC, Iteration 2048
Shrouded Keybag: pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC, Iteration 2048

So I'm looking for a couple things. Generally speaking, what exactly are these keybags? And also, how can I inspect them/determine how many I have per .p12 file using Ruby. Thanks. 
","A .p12 contains only 1 private key, and contains 1 or more public keys. The public keys are the ones that make the chain of trust.
.p12 is a binary format. To convert it and extract to individual certificates, look for example here. The link contains all the openssl commands you need.

"13852997","Access PFX File ECC PrivateKey For Symmetric Key Generation in Java","I'm writing a program (in Java using the Bouncy Castle API) that encrypts files with AES-256/GCM with a key generated by ONE EC key pair. I have the symmetric encryption portion working perfectly but now the key generation is proving to be difficult. When trying to use the ECPublicKey object in the javax.crypto.KeyAgreement.init() method, it returns this error:
Exception in thread ""main"" java.security.InvalidKeyException: ECDH key agreement requires ECPrivateKey for initialisation

    at Encrpytion.main(Encrpytion.java:40) ---byte[] key = generateKey();---

The source code for the method is as follows:

    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"");
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(""file.pfx"");
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    }
    KeyPair kp = new KeyPair(cert.getPublicKey(),(ECPrivateKey) key);

    aKA = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""BC"");
    aKA.init(key);
    aKA.doPhase(kp.getPublic(), true);
    return aKA.generateSecret();
}

How can I access the PrivateKey of the certificate?
**UPDATE: **updated sourcecode
** EDIT **
The following commands and instructions can be used to create some test files to demonstrate the problem.
#Make root key
openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -out root.key
#password protect key
openssl ec -in root.key -out root.key -aes256
####change req x509_attributes to rootCA
#selfsign root
openssl req -new -x509 -key root.key -out root.crt -days 1825 -config openssl.cfg
###comment out req x509_attributes
#make new key for clientCA
openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -out client.key
#make clientCA csr
openssl req -new -sha384 -key client.key -out client.csr -config openssl.cfg
#sign clientCA
openssl ca -out client.crt -name root -in client.csr -config openssl.cfg
#make client key

#make server csr
openssl req -new -sha384 -key client.key -out client.csr -config openssl.cfg
#sign server cert
openssl ca -out client.crt -name client -in client.csr -config openssl.cfg
#MAKE CHAIN - copy base64 encoded root and intermidiate client ca into same ""chain.cer"" #export user cert 
openssl pkcs12 -export -chain -CAfile chain.crt -in client.crt -inkey client.key -out client.pfx -aes256

","For any given alias only one of key and cert will be non-null. In this case evidently cert was non-null and key was null. If there is an EC private key in your keystore you will need to work a little harder to find it. You can determine what kind of entry is at the alias by testing with isCertificateEntry and isKeyEntry.
EDIT 1 
The error message is unfortunately confusing because it is actually coming from the bouncycastle library. The class referred to in ECDH key agreement requires ECPrivateKey is not java.security.interfaces.ECPrivateKey but rather org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.ECPrivateKey
The following short adaptation of the OPs sample code illustrates one way to overcome this.  
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCEECPrivateKey;
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JCEECPublicKey;
// ...
// . <original example code goes here>
// .
JCEECPrivateKey ecPrivKey = new JCEECPrivateKey((ECPrivateKey) key);
JCEECPublicKey ecPubKey = new JCEECPublicKey((ECPublicKey) cert.getPublicKey());
KeyPair kp = new KeyPair(ecPubKey, ecPrivKey);
KeyAgreement aKA = null;
aKA = KeyAgreement.getInstance(""ECDH"", ""BC"");
aKA.init(ecPrivKey);
aKA.doPhase(kp.getPublic(), true);
return aKA.generateSecret();

When you create a certificate to your mac, (.cer) you need to restart the computer after it, otherwise the login will not be connected to the new .cer (i had a previous one hence when i entered the administrator password ,he didn't accept it,because this login was under another .cer) .
Restarting the mac just solve the problem.

"23268542","Generate key files to connect to Bitbucket in Vagrant boxes","We use Vagrant boxes for development. For every project or small snippet we simply start a new box and provision it with Ansible. This is working fantastic; however, we do get into trouble when connecting to a private Bitbucket repository within a bower install run.
The solution we have now is to generate a new key (ssh-keygen), accept all defaults (pressing <return>, <return>, <return>) and then grab the public key (cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub). Copy it, go to Bitbucket, view your account and add this new ssh key. And repeat for every new box you instantiate.
We have to do this because of some closed source packages (hosted on Bitbucket) we install via Bower. We do have another experience, which is much better: composer (php's package manager) and private Github repositories. With that setup, you have to enter your username/password/2fa token via the command line and an OAuth token is generated for you. This works great.
So, is there a way we can mitigate this bower/bitbucket/ssh issue? For obvious reasons I don't want to provision the boxes with a standard private key, but there has to be another solution?
","While I'm not sure that my situation is as complex as yours (I'm not using Ansible or Bower), I solved this problem by using the Vagrant ssh forward agent.  This blog post gives you the details on how to get it working:
Cloning from GitHub in Vagrant using SSH agent forwarding
So as long as each of the developers has access on their local machines to the bitbucket repos, it should work.

"2959543","Load Java KeyStore for one alias?","Does anyone know if it is possible to load a KeyStore so that it only prompts for the password for the given alias?
Example:
In my key store i have two private keys: Alice's Encryption Certificate and Bob's Encryption Certificate.
When i load my key store:
keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""Windows-MY"", ""SunMSCAPI"");
keyStore.load(null);

I am prompted for both Alice's and Bob's key store password. Once they are entered i can use getKey(""Alice's Encryption Certificate"", null); to retrieve Alice's private key. My keys are protected by Entrust's Security Provider, it is who prompts me for the passwords upon loading the key store. If i do not enter Bob's password and try to get his key it will return null, which is fine, but i would like to avoid the password prompt.
Is it possible to somehow specify that i only want Alice's key before loading the key store so i am never prompted for Bob's password?
Thanks.
","We had the same issue and couldn't find a way to do it. Basically, you are asking if there is a way to load the keystore partially. It makes things more complicated that MSCAPI provider ignores any password you provide.
We get around the issue by storing only one key With MSCAPI keystore. It turns out this works better with the security model of Smartcard also.

","If you are using public-private (asymmetric) encryption, you always encrypt with the recipient's public key, who decrypts with their private key.  For digital signatures, you sign with your private key and the recipient verifies the signature with their public key.
The question then arises, how do you make a secure DRM system?  If you use encryption, and give the recipients a private key, they can distribute either the key or the decrypted content.  If you use signatures, they can simply strip out the signature verification part of your program.
The answer is that it's impossible.  The concept of DRM is fundamentally flawed.

","If you are encrypting something that is only to be read by a single recipient, then you encrypt with that recipients public key and they use their private key to read it.
If you are encrypting for multiple recipients, then you can encrypt with your private key and distribute your public key to those which you want to be able to read it.  This is usually called ""signing"" as anyone who has access to your public key can read it, so it's not really a form of private communication.
An overall more robust solution for you would be for your app to generate a key pair per installation, send the public key that it generated back to the server, which you would then use to encrypt so that only that single install could use the license that you created (by decrypting it with its private key).

","At least in a typical public key encryption algorithm (e.g., RSA) there's not really a major difference between the public and the private key. When you generate keys, you get two keys. You keep one private and publish the other -- but it doesn't matter much which one you publish and which one you keep private. 
Anything you encrypt with one key can be decrypted with the other key. For normal purposes, you publish one key, which lets anybody encrypt something that only you can decrypt. From a technical viewpoint, the reverse works fine though: if you encrypt something with your private key, anybody with the public key can decrypt it. This is typically used for things like signature verification (i.e., anybody with the public key can verify that the signature had to have been created with the private key). You usually want to use separate key pairs for encryption and signing though.
For your case, it's open to some question what you're really going to accomplish. You can certainly encrypt some data necessary to use the program, so the user needs the key to decrypt it and use the program -- but if the user is willing to give a copy of the code to an unauthorized person, they probably won't hesitate at giving a copy of the key to them as well. As such, even though the encryption/decryption will do it's job, it's unlikely to provide any real protection.
A more typical licensing scheme is tied to something like a specific IP address, so you do something like encrypting the IP address, then use the result as a key to decrypt data necessary to use the program. If the IP address is wrong, the data isn't decrypted correctly, and the program doesn't work. As long as the user has a static IP address this can work well -- but will cause problems in conjunction with DHCP.
My immediate advice would to just not do this at all. If you insist on doing it anyway, don't do it yourself -- get something like FlexNet to handle it for you. You're better off without it, but at least this way you'll get something that sort of works, and you won't waste time and effort on it that could be put to better purposes like improving your software.

","Congratulations, you just invented the RSA signature.  (Which is what you should be using, anyway.)  To communicate with a public key system, you need to use the private key once and the public key once, but RSA supports two different orders:
1) Encrypt with the public key, decrypt with the private: The recipient doesn't know anything about the source of the message, but the sender knows that only the recipient (the holder of the private key) can read it.  This is classical ""encryption"".
2) ""Encrypt"" with the private key, then ""decrypt"" with the public.  This is a digital signature, and provides authentication.  Anyone can read the message, but only the private key holder could have sent it.
Assuming your license is customized to the client (which could be as simple as including a copy of a client-generated random number), then it's useless to anyone else, but the client can be sure that the server sent it.
The symmetry isn't quite that neat in practice; the different modes of operation have different weaknesses and gotchas, so the implementation is typically significantly different, but that's the general idea.
One of the first and most important lessons in cryptology is understanding authentication and when to use it.  It's needed at least as often as encryption, and not knowing when to use it leaves you in a Midvale School for the Gifted situation.

(adding an answer in case someone else needs to decrypt similar php encoded stuff).
The first part was to decrypt de symmetricKey (""symkey"") from the metaData string
This was as Greg notes a Base64 encoded, RSA encrypted key which was decoded like so:
Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA"");
rsaCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
byte[] encryptedRijndaelKey = Base64.decodeBase64(base64EncodedSymetricKey); //from the metaData
byte[] rijndaelKeyBytes = rsaCipher.doFinal(encryptedRijndaelKey);

This Rijndael key was then used to decrypt de actual encrypted data like so:
RijndaelEngine rijndaelEngine = new RijndaelEngine(256); // *1 *2
KeyParameter keyParam = new KeyParameter(rijndaelKeyBytes)
rijndaelEngine.init(false, keyParam);  //false == decrypt
PaddedBufferedBlockCipher bbc = new PaddedBufferedBlockCipher(rijndaelEngine, new ZeroBytePadding()); // *3 

byte[] decryptedBytes = new byte[decryptedLenght]; //from the storageOptions string
int processed = bbc.processBytes(inputBytes, 0, inputBytes.length, decryptedBytes, 0);
bbc.doFinal(decryptedBytes, processed);

*1 because the Sun JCA only supports common AES which has a 128bits keysize i had to use a different provider (BouncyCastle).
*2 apparently the blocksize was also 256 bits (trail & error)
*3 apparently there was no padding used, thus the ZeroPadding for padding (again trail & error).

HCRYPTPROV cryptProvider = NULL;
HCRYPTKEY cryptKey = NULL;
CryptAcquireContext( &cryptProvider, ""MyTestKeyNumber123"", NULL, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_NEWKEYSET )

Call CryptImportKey to load the private key into the key store

if ( CertSetCertificateContextProperty( m_clientCertificate, CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID, 0, &privateKeyData ) )

Verify I can access the private key (Works, outputs exactly the same data as I have hardcoded into the application)

            HTTP_LOG_BUFFER(neGetGlobalTraceLog(), ""Key"", """", privateKeyBuffer, privateKeyBufferSize);
        }

At this stage, the private key is found but the call to CryptExportKey fails with NTE_BAD_KEY_STATE. When I try to use the client certificate with WinHTTP, I get ERROR_WINHTTP_CLIENT_CERT_NO_ACCESS_PRIVATE_KEY. If anyone is wondering, I tell WinHTTP to use the client certificate with this code:
if ( !WinHttpSetOption( handle,
                                WINHTTP_OPTION_CLIENT_CERT_CONTEXT,
                                const_cast<PCERT_CONTEXT>(m_clientCertificate),
                                sizeof( CERT_CONTEXT ) ) )
        {
            HTTP_LOG_ERROR( getLog(), ""Setting the client certificate failed with error code %x"", GetLastError() );
        }

The way I see it, until I can somehow link the private key and the certificate together and make it so that I can use CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey with CryptExportKey to get the key data back out, WinHTTP doesn't stand a chance of being succesful. 
Any thoughts as to why I can't seem to get my certificate to use the private key?
","I didn't manage to get this approach working. Instead, I ended up using PFXImportCertStore along with the raw .p12 file containing the certificate and private key I wanted to use. 
From what I've seen, it seems that PFXImportCertStore will create a new store in memory. The only thing I haven't been able to find out is if the private key is also stored in memory or if it ends up permenently on the PC somewhere. If I find out either way, I'll update this answer.
m_clientCertificateStoreHandle = PFXImportCertStore(&pfxData, certificatePassword, 0);
if(NULL != m_clientCertificateStoreHandle)
{
m_clientCertificateHandle = CertFindCertificateInStore( m_clientCertificateStoreHandle, X509_ASN_ENCODING | PKCS_7_ASN_ENCODING, 0, CERT_FIND_ANY, NULL, NULL );

","The error message means that the Java runtime could not find a crypto provider for ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) algorithms. 
Java 6 contains only basic support for ECC: It knows the OIDs of most EC algorithms and therefore knows that it must find an ""EC KeyFactory"". However, by default no provider is installed that can handle these algorithms. 
The SunEC provider with full ECC support was added in Java 7, so the easiest solution for this problem is to use keytool from a Java 7 or 8 runtime.

But if I add a user to the group of the user I would like to login, the login is not possible so far. I see an password prompt and am encouraged for enter password for the user, but my private key is not used anymore. After I had enter the right password, it works as well.
If I remove the user from the /etc/group again, the user is able again to login with key.
Only If at least one user in the group of the user, the ssh key login does not work anymore.
If anyone has a suggestion und would post this here, it would be very nice.

","Check the permissions of .ssh directory and the authorized_keys file.  If you have multiple users in the group and the directory is group writable, the keys are not used anymore. You can see it on the server from /var/log/auth.log where the sshd agent should report something like ""Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes""
The .ssh directory should have permissions 700 (only user can read, write, and execute). For files 600 (only user can read and write) are the best permissions. In some implementations also the home directory can't be group writable.
The reason for all this is that if the files are writable by group, anyone in that group could add their own key and login as you.

","A PKCS #8 file containing an encrypted private key has the following ASN.1 structure:

  encryptedData EncryptedData }

Notice how the encrypted data is only part of the total data package. You need to include this data in a sequence along with the encryption algorithm identifier. Your code above produces only the encryptedData part.

I would suggest you consider using BouncyCastle. It looks like they may have improved support for PKCS#8 recently. Here's some sample code:
KeyPairGenerator generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"");
KeyPair keyPair = generator.generateKeyPair();

final PrivateKey privKey = keyPair.getPrivate();

JceOpenSSLPKCS8EncryptorBuilder builder =
    new JceOpenSSLPKCS8EncryptorBuilder(PKCS8Generator.PBE_SHA1_3DES);

builder.setIterationCount(10000);
builder.setPasssword(""Hello, World!"".toCharArray());

OutputEncryptor outputEncryptor = builder.build();    
PKCS8Generator pkcs8Generator =
    new JcaPKCS8Generator(privKey, outputEncryptor);

try (PemWriter writer = new PemWriter(new PrintWriter(System.out))) {
  writer.writeObject(pkcs8Generator);
}

This will output an encrypted private key:

I want to use private_key to encrypt some string

Usually, when you ask for encrypt with the private key, what you want is a Probablistic Signature with Recovery (PSSR) scheme. By the way, encrypt with the private key is not a valid cryptographic transformation :)
The cryptlib.h header is described as Abstract base classes that provide a uniform interface to this library. All Crypto++ Signers and Verifiers adhere to the PK_SignatureScheme interface. Signers further implement PK_Signer, while Verifiers further implement PK_Verifier.
The Crypto++ RSA objects would look like so:
RSASS<PSSR, SHA256>::Signer signer;
RSASS<PSSR, SHA256>::Verifier verifier;

The Crypto++ Rabin objects would look like so:
RabinSS<PSSR, SHA256>::Signer signer;
RabinSS<PSSR, SHA256>::Verifier verifier;

The Crypto++ Rabin-Williams objects would look like so:
RWSS<PSSR, SHA256>::Signer signer;
RWSS<PSSR, SHA256>::Verifier verifier;

the objects are consistent, and you can swap them in and out.
By the way, you should look into Rabin-Williams to see if it fits your needs. Also see Bernstein's RSA signatures and Rabin–Williams signatures: the state of the art.


I'm using CryptoPP, the code for encoding works fine ...

Scrap it. The exponent you are using is well known, so there's no real security in what you are doing. There are ways to improve the security, but it sounds like you want a PSSR instead.
Here are the two example of using RSA's PSSR from the wiki:

RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme with Recovery
RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme with Recovery (Filter)

And here's the signer code for RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme with Recovery with some of your stuff dialed in. Note that you need a real RandomNumberGenerator because the signature is randomized.
Integer n(...), e(...), d(...);
RSA::PrivateKey key(n,e,d);
RSASS<PSSR, SHA256>::Signer signer(key);

////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Sign and Encode
SecByteBlock signature(signer.MaxSignatureLength(messageLen));

AutoSeededRandomPool rng;
size_t signatureLen = signer.SignMessageWithRecovery(rng, message, messageLen, NULL, 0, signature);

// Resize now we know the true size of the signature
signature.resize(signatureLen);


And here's the verifier code for RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme with Recovery with some of your stuff dialed in. Note that you don't need RandomNumberGenerator, so you can use NullRNG() if its needed somewhere.
Integer n(...), e(...);
RSA::PublicKey key(n,e);
RSASS<PSSR, SHA256>::Verifier verifier(key);

////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Verify and Recover
SecByteBlock recovered(
    verifier.MaxRecoverableLengthFromSignatureLength(signatureLen)
);

DecodingResult result = verifier.RecoverMessage(recovered, NULL, 0, signature, signatureLen);

if (!result.isValidCoding) {
    throw Exception(Exception::OTHER_ERROR, ""Invalid Signature"");
}

////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Use recovered message
//  MaxSignatureLength is likely larger than messageLength
recovered.resize(result.messageLength);



... but the decryption code throws an exception: ""class CryptoPP::InvertibleRSAFunction: Missing required parameter 'Prime1'""

Yep, encrypt with the private key is not a valid cryptographic transformation. I'm pretty sure decrypt with the public key is not valid, either :)

I'm not going to provide the code for encryption and decryption since I don't believe you need it. But you can find it at RSA Encryption Schemes on the Crypto++ wiki.

","So, you want to sign a message with your private key? This link has an example, maybe it helps (code and link below). Note also that not all signing is encryption. For example, ECDSA used by Bitcoin uses a signing operation that takes a random number as one input, no encryption is done as part of signing.

","Not fully sure what you are asking, but you can just join both the public and private key into a single file and that may be all you need for your application.

Therefore, we do not hope to deploy multiple private key files, but rather keep these keys as strings in an encrypted config file.

For an example of implementation, see JSch: addIdentity from private key stored on hdfs. 
See also Loading private key from string or resource in Java JSch in Android app for a format of the key in the buffers.

Alternatives:
There is also an addIdentity overload that takes an Identity interface:
public class JSch {

    public void addIdentity(Identity identity, byte[] passphrase)

Just implement the interface to get the private key from wherever you need.

","The manual states that New-SshSession accepts an OpenSSH key file for initiating and authenticating SSH connections. If you have been given a text file, you can make it into a compatible key file via Puttygen.exe (link grabbed from page), then you load the ppk into Puttygen, then copy&paste generated data. If you've received a HEX2BIN string (the one that has only 0213456789ABCDEF in it), you have to convert that into a Base64 string. (use http://base64decode.com/ or a similar service for that.)
If you'd fail to create a compatible file, request a text file starting with ssh-rsa from the issuer, probably linking this manual to him.

I think the problem should be between Vagrant and Mac Os. The same vagrant virtual machine works under a Windows environment.
","I had the same problem with ProxyJump directive while connecting through bastion host to an instance. The process was timing out after the same line. Turned out there was a problem with Firewall dropping connection from bastion host. 
As far as I can see your connection to 192.168.33.10 succeeds and hangs after opening listening port 5423 on localhost. So you either have a firewall blocking connections to localhost on port 5423 or a firewall on 192.168.33.10 blocking port 5423.
To solve this you have to test these ports manually with telnet\nmap utilities
The syntax is as follows:
telnet localhost 5423

or 
nmap -p 5423 192.168.33.10

If port is open you will see the following message 

Escape character is '^]'.

If port is closed by firewall telnet will hang with the following message

Trying 172.18.0.47...

If port is closed by fireawll nmap will show you that its filtered

PORT   STATE    SERVICE 
80/tcp filtered http

If port is open via firewall but there's no application listening on this port you will get a message

telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

After that you need to open those ports. On linux machines simply issue following command

Problem: I have encrypted file p7m (size 158KB) (it is crypted text). I have certificate in file pfx, under password ""a"". In this certificate is the public key which is needed to decrypt p7m file.
I need something that will read xyyv.p7m file, decrypt it with public key, and save it as XYZ.xyz
I do not put here any my code to do not confuse you. thanks
","A PKCS#7 structure can be very messy (and that's actually true for most ASN.1 structures). There's not much specific advice that can be given if we don't know what was used to produce this file.
In general there's code for reading them in System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs but it's easy to create files (valid or invalid) that won't be processed correctly. Even more if they were generated using different tools.
Mono provides classes, inside Mono.Security, to read them. They are very low-level API (with some helpers) so, in theory, they should be able to read anything... as long as you don't mind coding the processing your format itself.
Other libraries, BouncyCastle comes to mind, will offer similar (low or high level) API to process PKCS#7 files.

Saw this Using Android 4.1 Keychain , but somehow could not get to work with my case.
Code that does not work on 4.1, but works great on older versions.
PrivateKey pk;
try {
    pk = KeyChain.getPrivateKey(context,string);
    byte[] pkByte = pk.getEncoded();
    pkBase64 = new String(Base64.encode(pkByte, Base64.NO_WRAP));
}

Edited: Found out that if I do not change certificate alias(default hex-hex-hex) when adding it, then getPrivateKey returns null, but when I change alias to, for example, aaa method returns something, but still not the correct privatekey. (for example, returned private key with primeP =null primeQ =null. On Android 4.0.4 primeP and primeQ are not null values)
","You can't assume a PrivateKey can be encoded. If a PrivateKey returns null for getEncoded(), then it just doesn't support encoding. See the documentation for Key.getEncoded().
In JellyBean, the private keys returned via KeyChain are never in the process. Any operation performed on them are actually done in another process because the actual key matter may be stored in a hardware security module of some sort. You may still call java.security.Signature APIs with this key.

"11315650","Flash SecureSocket and RSA private key","I am trying to communicate to a server through SSL. The PEM client file is consisted of a certificate and an rsa private key.
I managed to convert both the certificate and key to binary DER. I load the DER certificate to SecureSocket succesfully (with function  addBinaryChainBuildingCertificate) but when I try to connect to the server I get a ""principal mismatch"" error. If I try to use the aforementioned function to load the DER key, I get a ""wrong parameter"" error.
I suppose the ""principal mismatch"" is because I haven't loaded the private key. But I see no function to load an RSA key to SecureSocket. Is there any solution to this? Do I need to communicate to the server with only a certificate but remove the key from the equation?

ERROR! Error #2031: Socket Error. URL: 127.0.0.1 : principalMismatch

","Firstly:
The ""principal mismatch"" indicates that the common name of the certificate on the secured server does not match the DNS name that you are connecting to.
Considering that you are making a connect to localhost (127.0.0.1) there will most certainly be a mismatch. Flash sockets are particularly strict when it comes to making secure connections and there is no mechanism to override security features unlike other runtimes (e.g. .NET and Java). The following must be true:

The certificate common name mush match the DNS name (there is a relaxation here for 'star' certs i.e. a cert for *.bob.com is considered valid for mr.bob.com)
The certificate must be valid in terms of expiry and trust chain

Secondly:
You seem to have some misconception on how certificates work. You do not need to add any certificates using the addBinaryChainBuildingCertificate() method if the server certificate is issued by a trusted root authority i.e. the certificate that signed the server certificate is in the local trust store of the target device.
To illustrate:

I have a certificate for this.is.awesome.com installed on my server and a DNS entry that resolves this.is.awesome.com to my server's IP Address
This certificate is issued by the Entrust L1C certificate authority.
The L1C certificate is in turn issued by the Entrust 2048 root authority.

On my PC I have the Entrust 2048 Root authority installed in my Trusted Root certificate store.
However I do not have the L1C certificate installed. When I attempt to connect to this.is.awesome.com the connection will fail as the server certificate cannot be validated against the L1C authority.
If I add the DER encoded L1C certificate using addBinaryChainBuildingCertificate() then the connection will succeed. The server certificate will be validated against the L1C certificate which will in turn be validated against the 2048 Root certificate which is a trusted root.
To summarize:
Your connection issues seem to stem from your attempt to connect to localhost.
Try adding an entry to your HOSTS file that maps the name on your certificate to 127.0.0.1 and then connecting to that name. If that fails check the issuer chain on your certificate and add the chain of issuers by calling addBinaryChainBuildingCertificate() once for each issuing certificate in the chain. The final or root certificate should be marked as such by passing true as the second parameter to addBinaryChainBuildingCertificate()

Answer:
The full content to be signed viz. PDF, or Data File or XML remains on the server and only hash of the content would be sent to client's browser to be signed using client's Digital Signature and Signed content would be sent back to server.

"26211480","Use JKS keystore for public key authentication with Ganymed SSH","I'm trying to extract a private key from a java keystore and then feed it to Ganymed SSH in order to establish a connection with public key authentication. It is however refusing to connect. 
I can successfully connect through Cygwin (ssh -i) with files generated by the following program, but the program itself is unable to get past authentication on the same machine. What am I doing wrong? 
I don't get an exception, Connection.authenticateWithPublicKey(String, char[], String) simply returns false, so this should not be a formatting problem. It does not matter if I leave the private key unencrypted, the result is the same. Also, I was able to connect with a program similar to this with files generated by putty-gen and ssh-keygen.
You will need the following to compile (bouncycastle and ganymed):

bcprov
bcpkix
ganymed-ssh2

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Connecting to 10.0.3.138:22
Authentication failure.

Edit01
I've tried this with jsch and sshj and all of them fail to connect. There has to be something wrong with the above code for private key extraction. What baffles me is that I can connect with ssh -i. Also, if I load the above private key into putty-gen, I get the same authorized_keys string as in output from my program (already present in my remote machine's .ssh/authorized_keys). But if I save it as a ppk file and then try to establish a putty session with it, it doesn't go through either (server refused our key).
","There's noting wrong with the code I posted. It was just a huge fail on my part. 
I used the keystore alias name as a username which did not exist as a user account on the remote linux box. After creating the account, everything works. I was editing the wrong authorized_keys file (on some other account) and expecting it to work through some obscure dark magic known only to leprechauns, unicorns and apparently my brain.
As for why it worked when I did ssh -i... Defaults. Stupid defaults. I did not specify a username at all so it defaulted to the one Cygwin was currently using and it just so happened that it had the same name as the account on the remote where I was editing the authorized_keys file.
Great. Awesome. Just..perfect. I need to go find a bridge to throw myself off from now.
Doing what I do in my code works with ganymed, jsch and sshj (with some small modifications for the other two APIs).

","What you need to use is an asymmetric scheme to transfer the info. With asymmetric encryption, even if someone is listening in, they can't know what they key is. You can encrypt the message using this, but generally you use it to encrypt a symmetric key and then use that from there on.
Have a look at this for more information about the background.
As for how to do it in your code, I would suggest googling something along the lines of ""java public key library"".

","First of all you never distribute private key, whilst public key can be publicly (duh!) available. You encrypt your message using the public key of the person on the second side of the chat, and they use their private key to decrypt it. You can send your public key using plaintext, via e-mail or publish it on your website so others can encrypt their messages to you with it.
To make your life easier invest in using e.g. ssl - which is much faster since after establishing secure channel using asymmetric encryption it exchanges symmetric session keys and uses much faster symmetric encryption.
Actually, distributing of a public key might be an issue as well. If your opponent can also modify the transmission (as opposed to only listening to your transmission channel) he/she can send bogus public key of yours. That's why public keys (e.g. on website) need to be signed by the chain of trusted authorities (whose public keys are hard-coded in the web browser).

"18657311","Instantiating a X509Certificate object in C# which holds a private key as well","I'm trying to implement a secure TCP server and as the result I need to create an object of class X509Certificate2 in order to authenticate the clients.
I believe such a certificate object should contain the private key (as well) in order to be able to decrypt incoming messages, isn't that true? Well no matter how I generate a certificate file, when I give its file address to X509Certificate2's constructor the object's HasPrivateKey property is false and clients are not authenticated!
In the Microsoft's page on how to use the X509Certificate2 class, in source code's comments it indicates that the certificate can be generated using makecert program like this:
makecert -r -pe -n ""CN=CERT_SIGN_TEST_CERT"" -b 01/01/2010 -e 01/01/2012 -sky exchange -ss my

In which -pe switch should include the private key in certificate but looking at the generated file I can tell that it does not do that.
Since I'm implementing this software in Ubuntu using Mono I thought I can use openssl instead. So following the instructions given in this page I created a private key and a public key. X509Certificate2 class accepts the public key as if it was created by makecert command but not the private key (it throws an exception when it is constructed).
There is a relatively old post in SO which asks the same question but it has no accepted answer. And the two given ones suggest using two different formats for certificates, PKCS8 and PKCS12 while in the documentation it is clearly said that X509Certificate make use of PKCS7!
Anyway I'm all confused. Has anyone ever been able to use X509Certificate2 with a private key loaded? How?
","An X509 certificate should only contain a public key.  It binds the public key to an identity and is signed.  RFC 5280 contains the details on X509 certificates.
However, the X509Certificate2 object can contain a private key according to the MSDN documentation.
Also, a keystore, such as a PKCS12 keystore can contain a private key and a corresponding certificate.
PKCS7 is a specification for signing and encrypting messages.
PKCS8 is a specification for private keys.
See PKCS for the differences between different PKCS standards.
The MSDN link above has some example C# code to encrypt and decrypt files.  It also has an example makecert command line to generate a certificate.  However this certificate and associated private key is stored in the Windows local user store, so I'm not sure if that will translate correctly to Ubuntu.
There is also some discussion in this SO question about using PKCS12 keystores to instantiate the X509Certificate2 object and then to access the private key.  This might be the better way for you to accomplish your goal.  You can use openssl to generate a private key, a signed certificate, and import them into a PKCS12 keystore.  You can create a PKCS12 keystore using the commands here.  For example, create a text file (file.pem) containing both the PEM format of your private key and corresponding X509 certificate.  Then run this command:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in file.pem -out file.p12 -name ""My Certificate""

Also on the makecert documentation page, it says, ""for testing purposes only"".  So I wouldn't depend on those certificates for a production secure server.

","Thank all! I have solved it myself. My mistake is did not use the absolute path in git link. Also, I didn't set git user's home directory correctly so cause the error permission denied too.
Then remove end line characters from each SSH key on authorized_keys. That'll did the trick!

"34549899","SSL Connection, Windows Certificate Store and CAPI engine","I am creating an SSL connection using OpenSSL API. As we know in a SSL handshake, series of Certificate Authentication occurs for Server or Client. Now for client certificate authentication, the client's certificate and associated private key are stored in Windows Certificate Store.
This certificate with private key is imported into the store after combining them into a pfx format and then that pfx file is imported to the windows Cert store. Now while importing this pfx file using mmc snap-in it asks whether we want to make the private key exportable or not. Now OpenSSL comes into picture for making SSL connection.
For that we have to create SSL_CTX object in which all the connection related properties are loaded. Now for loading private key from windows certificate store into SSL_CTX object, i have marked that private key exportable that i am exporting the key using Crypto API. But I think marking a private key exportable does not make any sense, it's a security breach.
Since private key will always be marked Non-Exportable so, is there any method or API of OpenSSL, etc that can directly read and load private key from windows cert store into SST_CTX object for making a SSL connection.
I know definitely there is some way for this to work but i am not getting it.
I have searched a lot for this but not got the required thing.
Summarized Question: The Certificate Store holds many certificates and associated private keys. How are the certificates and private keys accessed when making an SSL connection ?
EDIT : I have gone through an openssl engine API called 
 `EVP_PKEY *ENGINE_load_private_key(ENGINE *e, const char *key_id,
      UI_METHOD *ui_method, void *callback_data);`

Now how can i get this key_id of the private key and also i think this api internally called crypto api CryptExportKey and this api fails if private key is marked non-exportable.

"42413592","java - need to import private key from jks(java keystore)","I have a stored my certificate in Java KeyStore which is required for accessing Restful API. To access this API I need to create JWT (Json Web Token) which I am implementing in Java. For generating JWT I need to sign the payload with given private key.
So, what I am doing is, importing private key from .jks file into my code 
FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(""src/main/resources/file.jks"");
            KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
            keystore.load(is, ""password"".toCharArray());  
PrivateKey privateKey = (PrivateKey) keystore.getKey(""key"", """".toCharArray());
JWTClaimsSet claimsSetOne = new JWTClaimsSet.Builder()
                .subject(""alias"")
                .issueTime(new Date(123000L))
                .issuer(""https://issuer"")
                .audience(""https://audience"")
                .build();

JWSSigner signer = new RSASSASigner(privateKey);
SignedJWT signedJWT = new SignedJWT (new JWSHeader(JWSAlgorithm.RS256), claimsSetOne);
signedJWT.sign(signer);
String orderOne = signedJWT.serialize();

Now, with this piece of code, It returns private key as ""null"" value. which results into failure of my code.
So, what could be my code so that I can read private key to sign the payload to generate JWT.
Or any other alternative to achieve same.
Thanks in advance.
Edit :
Then I tried this command,
File file = new File(""src/main/resources/sho1.jks"");
InputStream   is = new FileInputStream(file);
KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
String password = ""sho123"";
keystore.load(is, password.toCharArray());

KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry keyEnt = 
   (KeyStore.PrivateKeyEntry) keystore.getEntry(""sho"",new KeyStore.PasswordProtection(password.toCharArray()));
PrivateKey privateKey = keyEnt.getPrivateKey();

It gives me error as Invalid_Signature.
","Nothing is wrong in the implementation of JAVA code. This code works fine. Error which I getting as INVALID_SIGNATURE is due to JKS. The certificate which I importing that is not the proper i.e. It does not have  correct certificate path. I tried importing correct way then it works.
So make sure in this type of scenario you are importing certificate with correct keypair to get correct fingerprint in the JKS.
Thanks all.

"34945941","APNs certificate missing private key when generating with custom keychain","I was trying to generate a new APNs certificate for my app on our build server but when I got to the ""Export 2 items"" step for the Certificate and Private Key, I found that I didn’t have two items.  My certificate didn’t have any private key with it.
I can see in my keychain that the certificate belongs to the System keychain whilst the public and private key are in my CI-Jenkins keychain.
I repeated the process on my development machine and it worked fine there.
The only difference being that the build server is currently set to use our custom CI-Jenkins keychain as opposed to the default login keychain.
Anybody knows what is happening there and if it makes sense? Do I need to swap keychain before generating the certificate and then swap back on my build server?
","The solution is to just drag the certificate from the System keychain to the login keychain. Then it will automatically associate the correct private key with it.

This looks like some sort of Java serialization format. You will need to convert it to a format which OpenSSL supports (e.g, DER), then load it using openssl_pkey_get_private().

","You are serializing Java objects, then reading them as byte arrays in PHP and trying to use them directly as keys. This just won't work.
First, you need to output the key pair in an interchangeable format. Next, you can't just read those bytes into memory and treat them as a key pair. You need to decode the format in PHP to reconstitute the key pair. You can use openssl to do this.
In Java, you can write out the key pair in DER format. Modify your code like this, for example:
// Saving the Public key in a file
FileOutputStream publicKeyOS = new FileOutputStream(publicKeyFile);
publicKeyOS.write(key.getPublic().getEncoded());
publicKeyOS.close();

// Saving the Private key in a file
FileOutputStream privateKeyOS = new FileOutputStream(privateKeyFile);
privateKeyOS.write(key.getPrivate().getEncoded());
privateKeyOS.close();

You can verify these files using openssl at the shell prompt like this:
$ openssl rsa -inform DER -in private.key
$ openssl rsa -inform DER -pubin -in public.key

In PHP, you can read these binary files and have openssl decode the DER... well, it appears that you cannot use DER directly in the PHP implementation of openssl, so you'll have to first convert the DER to PEM.
Finally, you can use openssl to decode the PEM into the public and private keys.
For example, in PHP:
// (You could also convert the DER to PEM elsewhere, before PHP reads the files.)
function der2pem($der_data, $kind)
{
  $pem = chunk_split(base64_encode($der_data), 64, ""\n"");
  $pem = ""-----BEGIN "".$kind.""-----\n"".$pem.""-----END "".$kind.""-----\n"";
  return $pem;
}

function to_pem($filename, $kind)
{
  // TODO: handle errors
  $f = fopen($filename, ""r"");
  $der = fread($f, filesize($filename));
  $pem = der2pem($der, $kind);
  fclose($f);
  return $pem;
}

function load_private_key($filename)
{
  $pem = to_pem($filename, ""PRIVATE KEY"");
  return openssl_pkey_get_private($pem);
}

function load_public_key($filename)
{
  $pem = to_pem($filename, ""PUBLIC KEY"");
  return openssl_pkey_get_public($pem);
}

$private_key = load_private_key(""private.key"");

$public_key = load_public_key(""public.key"");

if (openssl_public_encrypt(""Hello"", $ciphertext, $public_key))
{
  if (openssl_private_decrypt($ciphertext, $recovered_plaintext, $private_key))
  {
    echo $recovered_plaintext;
  }
}

"11858420","Manage Keys with Puppet for puppet-vcsrepo","I'm setting up some server configuration in my company and we have some internal repositories that run over ssh through bzr that I need to get. I wanted to use puppet-vcsrepo to pull these in and I saw that it has a way we can use a keyfile to get what we want. What is the best way to go about this?
I'm probably going to make a user account for each of us, but do I have to put my private key into puppet as a file and then transfer it over? How do I manage keys inside of puppet so I can checkout repositories ssh without using username and password?
Here is a link to the information: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo/blob/master/README.BZR.markdown
It says to manage keys with puppet, but I couldn't exactly find what I need to know in order to manage the keys correctly.
","Don't know much about BZR... will answer as if it was a git/github based question

If you are github based, use deploy keys (readonly access, easily revokable) and not a developer key. 
You can manage the key by copying them in ~/.ssh and configure ssh to use it ?


file { '/user/home/.ssh/id_rsa-github-mycompany' :
 ... # access right ....
}
vcsrepo { ""/path/to/repo"":
  ...
  require => File[ '/user/home/.ssh']
}

you may need to tweek also the .ssh/config to use this identify file and modify the host name of the git repository

Host github-mycompany-project
HostName github.com
  User git
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa-github-mycompany
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Another option use an exec and the git_ssh_wrapper gem instead of vcsrepo ?

""Server 1"" is having ""Server 1's"" private key and public key of ""Server 2"".
""Server 2"" is having ""Server 2's"" private key and public key of ""Server 1"".

In JSch, when I use a Java program to communicate from ""Server 1"" to ""Server 2"", the program is using addIdentity method. This method is using ""Server 1's"" private key and JSch will not send this to anybody (""Server 2""), am I right?
Am confused with mentioning private key in this in addIdentity method. If possible please give me some JSch related doc which enlighten me more.
","Your understanding is correct.
The .addIdentity is used to specify what private key should be used to locally encrypt the data before sending them to the remote server (and to decrypt the incoming data). The private key itself is not sent anywhere. Only a public key is.
Note that the .addIdentity loads a key pair (both the public and the private key). Even if you use an overload that takes prvkey path only, the JSch assumes that the public key file has the same name, just .pub extension; or that the ""private key"" file actually contains both public and private key.

For details, read about Public-key/asymmetric cryptography.

Though note that the key is a private key of the account you are connecting with to the remote server. It's not (should not be) a private key of the local machine (even if the machine happens to be a [SSH] server).

"38178683","In Android, how to ensure that Private Key is stored inside secure hardware","KeyInfo's isInsideSecureHardware-method's return value seems to depend on device model, os version, and some other random factors.
For example when using Sony xperia z5 compact with older os version isInsideSecureHardware() could return true for some time and then suddenly start returning false for the same Private Key.
With the latest os version (32.2.A.0.224) it seems to return only false.
Huawei Nexus 6P returns always true.
Is there a way to make sure that the key is stored in secure hardware?
Here is my current code:
KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_RSA, ""AndroidKeyStore"");

boolean secure = keyInfo.isInsideSecureHardware(); //  this usually returns false

Edit:
In sony support forum there is a topic about the same problem:
https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Android-development/hardware-backed-keystore/td-p/1154124
It was mentioned that following warning is printed to logs:

W keystore: Primary keymaster device failed to generate key, falling back to SW.

","According to the Android API, the only way to verify it is to first create the key then look at the information to ensure it is hardware-backed. 
Looking at the specs for the phone, it was originally released on Lollipop.  That was before the official Marshmallow Fingerprint API/hardware specs and manufacturers were doing their own thing.  This article mentions the device you are using specifically (http://blog.elcomsoft.com/2016/06/fingerprint-unlock-security-ios-vs-google-android-part-ii/).  I am wondering if whether the true values you were getting back were incorrect and then due to your O/S upgrade it fixed the logic (or broke it?). The O/S upgrade version you mention contains ""1 April 2016 Google security patches""
I have a few questions:

What does isUserAuthenticationRequirementEnforcedBySecureHardware() return on your device now?  Is the value consistent?  If it's false that could tell you that the fingerprint reader is not considered secure (or there is an O/S defect)
What does older OS version mean, exactly? Lollipop? Have you tried resetting to factory defaults?

Is there available any php commands for this? 
p.s. (shell_exec or similar not allowed on hosting)
","I have found the way! :
=======STEP 1 ====
<<< Generating Private Key (rsa/key/pem) & CSR [Certificate Signing Request] >>>
Although there is a PHP code,it can only generate PRIVATE KEY, not CSR.
You should better to use openSSL commands to get PRIVATE+ CSR keys

For openssl commands (typical examples) use your Hosting SSH terminal (if it supports) or your Localhost (if you use Apache/Wampserver/ or etc..):
-in CMD, type: cd c:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\bin, then execute such  command:
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr -config c:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\conf\openssl.cnf

then it will ask you some questions... you should input domain name when it asks for ""common name"" (i.e.  example.com).... After you are done, in the same location c:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\ you will see  Private key(server.key) and CSR key (server.csr). Go on...

========STEP 2 - Add CERTIFICATE (.crt) ========
Now, enter your DOMAIN Register dashboard (where you have SSL issued), and re-issue that. when it asks for CSR and PRIVATE KEY, enter the contents of the files we generated (open them in text editor)... Then you can go on (EMAIL verification is quickest way) and then you should get confirmation mail from your SSL provider (or Domain dashboard), where you can download the CERTIFICATE (xxxxxxxx.crt and xxxxxx.ca-bundle files)....  Then go to HOSTING dashboard,and in SSL section, use the codes CSR/PRIVATE/CRT keys appropriately !!!!!!
p.s. If you will get REDIRECT LOOP error, then you might have to re-install site/Wordpress.

"13640650","Calculating VS_KEY container name","How does one calculate VS_KEY container name? They are generally something like this: VS_KEY_71E582524B5DDE29.
I'm assuming it's based on computer name but what if we have a cloud service running that changes the computer name randomly every time the instance restarts?
We need to have the container name when the instance goes up so we know what container to store our private keys into so build tools and all work as they should. We need to automatically set the container name.
So basically we need to figure out a way to generate correct container name every time the computer reboots. Any tips or help?
","We stepped upon this question while trying to automatically register the key on an integration server. Having to run Visual Studio or MSBuild to extract the VS_KEY was unacceptable. Then by investigating the logs of MSBuild with the maximal verbosity, I came upon the following.
This key is generated via Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dll (present in GAC). There's a class called ""ResolveKeySource"" within this DLL. By looking at the code with ILSpy or Reflector, you will see an Execute method calling ResolveAssemblyKey. This method is the heart of the VS_KEY_xxxxxx mystery. 
The VS_KEY_xxxxx value is generated by hashing the content of the key with Environment.UserDomainName and Environment.UserName.
First solution: you create an ResolveKeySource instance and call the appropriate method. As you don't provide a password and other information, it will raise an exception whose message contains the mighty VS_KEY thing.
var key = new ResolveKeySource();
key.KeyFile = path_to_key_file;
try {
   key.Execute();
} catch (Exception e) {
  var match = Regex.Match(e.Message, ""VS_KEY_[A-F0-9]+"");
   if (match.Success) {
       return match.Value;
   }
}

Second solution: grab the code that is generating this hashcode and use it to directly get the value without exceptions. This is more or less an extract from the DLL.
    public static string GetLocalUserKeyContainerByGeneration(string keyFile) {

        string localName = Environment.UserDomainName + ""\\"" + Environment.UserName;

        FileStream keyFileStream = null;

        try {
            keyFileStream = File.OpenRead(keyFile);

            int num = (int)keyFileStream.Length;
            byte[] array = new byte[num];

            keyFileStream.Read(array, 0, num);

            ulong hash1 = HashFromBlob(array);
            byte[] bytes = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(localName.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture));

            return ""VS_KEY_"" + (hash1 ^ HashFromBlob(bytes)).ToString(""X016"", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        }
        finally {
            if (keyFileStream != null) {
                keyFileStream.Close();
            }
        }
    }

    private static ulong HashFromBlob(byte[] data) {

        uint num = 17339221u;
        uint num2 = 19619429u;
        uint num3 = 10803503u;

        for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++) {
            byte b = data[i];
            uint num4 = (uint)b ^ num3;
            num3 *= 10803503u;
            num += (num4 ^ num2) * 15816943u + 17368321u;
            num2 ^= ((num4 + num) * 14984549u ^ 11746499u);
        }

"10305616","Any concern to share private key for distribution certificate among different group under a team account in itune provisioning portal","We are a large university and have a single team account in apple itunes provisioning portal. We have serval different groups developing iOS apps, which will be published under the team account (university name). It seems apple only allows to create one distribution certificate. To publish apps, each group will need the private key to sign the app. If we choose to share the private key among all groups, is there any concern?
Someone also suggested revoking the current certificate. I understand it will not affect the current apps in store. But others will have to revoke the certificate again when they want to publish an update, will they?
Otherwise, is there any other solution to this problem if not sharing the private key?
","Application distribution is the team agent's task so she is the only person supposed to be in the possession of the distribution certificate's private key. The provisioning portal doesn't have any method of sharing the private key, and I don't think it would ever have such kind of functionality.
The expected way(expected by Apple) is that all apps developed by different groups in an organization are sent to the team agent, who then signs and uploads them to the store.
The normal way(what I have seen in 4 organizations I have worked with) is that the agent shares the private key with leads of the different groups, working on an app.
Revoking the distribution certificate every time, although may not hurt the apps already on the store but definitely would cause unnecessary headaches.

I need to sign NSData with RSA private key which is provided from backoffice. Private key is received in form of string.
How to achieve this? I do not want to create my own key pairs, I just want to use that single PRIVATE key to sign NSData. 
I found several solutions using OPENSSL, but none of them works and I am not able to find any suitable solution for my problem with native CommonCrypto library.
In fact, this is a piece of Android code I need to replicate:
public static PrivateKey getPrivateKey() throws Exception {
String key = ContentHolder.getInstance(context).getClientPrivateKey();
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec spec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(android.util.Base64.decode(key, android.util.Base64.NO_WRAP));
KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
return kf.generatePrivate(spec);

- this one returns Private key which is generated from string stored in app's database
public String sign(byte[] array) throws SignatureException {
        try {
            Signature sign = Signature.getInstance(""SHA1withRSA"");
            sign.initSign(privateKey);
            sign.update(array);
            return android.util.Base64.encodeToString(sign.sign(), android.util.Base64.NO_WRAP);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            throw new SignatureException(ex);
        }
    }

- this returns signed byte array in form of base64 string
How to achieve this in iOS? I spent many hours searching web and trying several approaches, none of them was successful.
I would be very thankful for any code snippets, since hints like ""CommonCrypto should do this"" do not work for me.
Thank you very much
","The main problem is that Apple officially doesn't support signing using a string-key (https://devforums.apple.com/message/641836#641836). They insist on using .p12 and importing it using SecPKCS12Import.

Well, for any ssh-powered repositories you must to define used ssh-client in (global, user- or repository-specific) config file. For key-based authorization you can define private-key file as parameter of used command or use special additional tool (ssh-agent in *Nix or pageant in Win or...)
Sample
Windows-box with Mercurial (TortoiseHG), full Putty, without Cygwin
Key-based authorization for ssh-repositories: Plink + Pageant
Global mercurial.ini part
[ui]
merge = ...
username = ...
ssh = ""PATH\TO\TortoisePlink.exe"" 

Also Pageant is running and (putty-type) private keys for published public keys loaded into it
When I connect to any ssh-repo, authorization happens automagically
Pageant-less version may include

-i KEYFILE option for TortoisePlink at the repository level - in the .hg\hgrc
--load SESSION option for TortoisePlink (same location as above) for using previously created Putty's session, which have all needed authorization predefined

","Is you private key encrypted?
To determine if your private key is encrypted:
grep ENCRYPTED /etc/pki/tls/private/test.key

If yes, remove the password from the private key:
openssl rsa -in /etc/pki/tls/private/test.key -out /etc/pki/tls/private/test-new.key

Check the header of your private key, should look like this:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

And check the footer, should look like this:
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

Remove any space or newline after the footer.
Hope this helps

","Unfortunately, I haven't found a solution to the exact problem you've described, however, there are a few work-arounds you may find useful:

If you have access to the .NET source, you can export your keys as PEM.  (I'm not positive if this is possible through the standard system libraries, but it is certainly supported by BouncyCastle. 
If you can afford to use another language to translate the key, this can be done relatively easy in perl.
use Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA;
use Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum;
use MIME::Base64;
$modulus = Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum->new_from_bin(decode_base64($XMLModulus));
$exponent=  Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum->new_from_bin(decode_base64($XMLExponent));
# You can reading in the remaining parameters is the same as the first two
# dq, dp, and inverseQ are not needed
$privateKey = Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->($modulus, $exponent, $d, $p, $q)
# Outputs it in a standard binary form (DER) which PHP should support.
print $privateKey->get_private_key_string()
# If you need PEM, openssl can definitely convert it.

Sorry I couldn't get you a solution in PHP proper.  Hopefully the C# solution will work though.

","You are getting SW 6985 for
// Set the hash of the document
00 2A 90 A0 14 HASH OF DOCUMENT
-> 69 85

Since you have not set the correct context in current security environment.
Let me explain this below
First you performed VERIFY PIN command which was successful
// Verify PIN
00 20 00 01 04 31 32 33 34
-> 90 00

Then you performed MSE SET command,Where you set the security context.For this you have to understood how SE works(Please refer to section 3.5 fron IAS ECC v1.01).
At the time of personalisation, the Personaliser agent create SDO(Secure Data Object) inside the card.The reference to this SDO are mentioned in SE(Security Environment) in form of CRT(Control reference template).
// Create a context for security operation
00 22 41 B6 06 84 01 84 80 01 12
-> 90 00

Generally speaking, MSE SET command will always return SW 900 even if the SDO reference is wrong. Since it only return SW 6A80 when the template is wrong not when the reference is wrong.(The SDO reference is passed in tag 84)
After that you performed PSO HASH command
// Set the hash of the document
00 2A 90 A0 14 HASH OF DOCUMENT
-> 69 85

where the card return SW 6985(Condition of use not satisfied), This indicate the algorithm and SDO reference used for calculating Hash may  wrong. Which is probably happening since the SDO reference which was sent during the time of MSE SET command is not available
Detecting error coming from MSE SET could be tricky since it return SW 9000.
For these type of situation you have to check the personalisation file carefully and need to match the MSE SET command with regard to SDO reference and supported ALGOs.
It may be useful to put the default context (e.g., cryptographic algorithms or
security operations) into the current SE in order to have few exchanges of MSE set commands.

RSA *r = EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA( private_key);

","
EVP_PKEY *private_key = PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey( bio, ,,,)
I'd like to wipe out private_key from memory cleanly before using EVP_PKEY_free to free it.

OpenSSL's EVP_PKEY_free wipes the private key for you. You don't have to do anything special.

RSA *r = EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA( private_key);

The get1 means the reference count was bumped and you effectively got your own copy of the object. A get0 means you got a pointer to an existing object, and you should not call free on it. Because of get1, you must call RSA_free on it to ensure it gets deleted. As with EVP_PKEY_free, RSA_free will wipe the key.
Please don't call memset. These are opaque structures, and you have to follow a number of pointers to correctly clear the sub-objects. A lot more fields have been hidden in OpenSSL 1.1.0, so its going to be more difficult to follow the pointers (if you wanted to).  Also see Error: “invalid use of incomplete type ‘RSA {aka struct rsa_st}” in OpenSSL 1.1.0, Visual Studio and error C2027: use of undefined type 'rsa_st' in OpenSSL 1.1.0, EVP_get_cipherbyname and “undefined struct/union evp_cipher_st” in OpenSSL 1.1.0, etc.

Here's some additional reading you might be interested in:

Why does OPENSSL_cleanse look so complex and thread-unsafe?
Removing OPENSSL_cleanse from OpenSSL-1.0.1r

When functions like EVP_PKEY_free and RSA_free are called, they eventually end in a call to OPENSSL_cleanse before memory is returned to the operating system. In the case of an RSA private key, its called at leats 8 times to wipe the byte arrays associated with n, e, d, p, q, dp, dq, and invq.

","Have a look at Swift-RSAUtils, it provides what you need. I cannot thank Thanh Ba Nguyen enough for his fantastic pioneer work in this field. Apple, shame on you for making developers' lives so miserable!
Basically, the story is this: you must load the keys in their DER or PEM format (and decode base64 in case of PEM), then strip some parts from it, then import the keys to the system's keyring. Once this is done you can fetch them from the keyring and use them. Unfortunately, Apple hasn't documented this, particularly for Swift. The only reference documentation I could find was Certificate, Key, and Trust Services Reference, and be sure you click ""both"" not only ""Swift"" or you won't see much.

According to GoDaddy:
To install a digital certificate, you must first generate and submit a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the Certification Authority (CA). The CSR contains your certificate-application information, including your public key. Use your Web server software to generate the CSR, which will also create your public/private key pair used for encrypting and decrypting secure transactions.
http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/5343/generating-a-certificate-signing-request
It also states: NOTE: When generating your CSR, specify a key size of 2048 or higher.
The key size is sometimes the culprit. Hope it helps.

","Generally speaking, in browser cryptography can be considered a bad idea. Sending the data over ssl-tls would likely be much more secure than a home-brewed crypto solution, like you seem to be suggesting. This can be considered especially bad when transmitting data like credit card info, as it appears you will be.
http allows for extremely easy man in the middle attacks to eavesdrop on any data being sent either way, so there would almost certainly be no secure way to transmit the keys in the first place, let alone the secure information. 
If you really really want to go this route, then have a look at crypto-js.
This is not a good idea, and you should use SSL. Probably hence the downvotes.
Considering your use case, the best way to do this would probably be to host your own central service with SSL enabled, and route all ajax requests to your service, not theirs. Their servers could then poll your server using your SSL certificate, to view any relevant information. So you would be acting as some sort of centralised API, with both the clients and businesses connecting. You still need to consider however, that any information sent in the clear, ie over http, not https, can be tampered with before it reaches the user.
As far as I am aware, no, you cannot generate SSL certificates on the fly.

My direction is using some external open source keystore (any suggestions?) which I'll compile as part of my app (and because android doesn't share information between apps it will be ok to use).

"42285185","SSH Public Key Authentication with Libssh2 C++","I am working on a project where I am doing port forwarding to MySQL using libssh2 in C++. I've got it working for username/password authentication but I now want do it using public/private key authentication. The documentation for libssh2 is pretty poor so I am having difficult working out what I need to do. 
What I am trying to do is have an Android app post data to my C++ app, where C++ will be given the SSH details along with the auth key and it creates the SSH tunnel. C++ is getting the key fine and then I am doing the following to do the public key authentication. 
else if (this->getAuthMethod() == SupportedAuthMethods::AUTH_PUBLICKEY)
    {

        string test = this->getSSHPrivateKey();

        boost::replace_all(test, ""\n"", """");

        unsigned char * key = (unsigned char *)test.c_str();

        size_t sizeofkey = strlen((char*)key);
        cout << key << endl;
        stringstream logstream;
        logstream << ""Using public key authentication for SSH Host: "" << this->getSSHHostnameOrIPAddress();
        this->bitsLibrary->writeToLog(logstream.str(), ""SSHTunnelForwarder"", ""authenticateSSHServer"");
        if (chosenAuthMethod & SupportedAuthMethods::AUTH_PUBLICKEY)
        {
            //int result = 0;
            int result = libssh2_userauth_publickey(this->session, this->getUsername().c_str(), key, sizeofkey, SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete, 0);
            if (result != 0)
            {
                char * error = NULL;
                int len = 0;
                int errbuf = 0;
                libssh2_session_last_error(this->session, &error, &len, errbuf);
                this->bitsLibrary->writeToLog(std::string(error), ""SSHTunnelForwarder"", ""auth"");
                JSONResponseGenerator jsonResponse;
                jsonResponse.generateJSONResponse(API_AUTH_FAILURE, ""InvalidPublicKey"");
                return jsonResponse.getJSONString();

            }
        }
    }

I read somewhere that it shouldn't have new lines, that's why I'm replacing the \n for blank characters but with or without this it doesn't make a difference. 
The very basic documentation mentions that one of the arguments for libssh2_userauth_publickey is a callback as follows:
int name(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned char **sig, size_t *sig_len, const unsigned char *data, size_t data_len, void **abstract);
but I cannot find any information anywhere as to what this callback is or what it should contain. In my function call to libssh2_userauth_publickey I pass in SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete and currently this function just has the following:
int SSHTunnelForwarder::publicKeyAuthComplete(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, unsigned char **sig, size_t *sig_len,
    const unsigned char *data, size_t data_len, void **abstract)
{
    cout << ""In SSH Auth Callback"" << endl;
    return 0;
}

This method above doesn't get called, although I'm expecting that this isn't even close to being correct. 
When I run my code above the result of libssh2_userauth_publickey is 19 and the error that is returned from the get_last_message() method is invalid public key. I know the public key file is fine as I can use it in an SSH app on Android and can successfully authenticate with my server. 
UPDATE 1
I've managed to make some progress, I found there is a function called:
libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, size_t username_len, const char *publickeyfiledata, size_t publickeyfiledata_len, const char *privatekeyfiledata, size_t privatekeyfiledata_len, const char *passphrase);

The libssh2 version that I had was from NuGet Package manager and found that the latest version in this is actually quite old, so I've build the latest 1.7.0 version from GitHub inside Visual Studio and relinked my project to this new version. 
I have now replaced the original publickey auth function I was using with this version so my code now looks like this instead:
int result = libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(this->session, username.c_str(), username.length(), nullptr, 0, test.c_str(), sizeofkey, nullptr);

This function confuses me a little that it wants the public key and the private key, for everything I know about SSH (admittedly not a huge amount) the public key stays on the server, and the user wanting to login only has access to the private key. 
I found that someone else was asking this and a patch was done to allow a null pointer for the public key, so I have passed nullptr for the public key and 0 for the public key length. I've also put a nullptr for the certificate passphrase as this hasn't been set. 
When I run this code now I now get the error -18 which is invalid username/public key combination. Again though, I know the username and private key file I am using is correct as I can use it in an SSH client application on Android to connect to my SSH server. 
","I've found the solution. What I did in update 1 was the actual fix but my server key got changed for some reason not sure why, so when it said that it couldn't link the username with the key it was correct. 
The complete fix is as follows:
Don't use the libssh2 from NuGet its very old. I downloaded the latest source from GitHub at https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/releases and then completed the follwing steps to build libssh2 within Visual Studio. 

Shove all the .c files in libssh2/src into an empty Win32 C++ (DLL 
or Static Library) project except libgcrypt.c/openssl.c of which you 
only pick the one appropriate to your crypto library. 
Add your OpenSSL or libgcrypt include directory to the project include path 
Add libssh2/include to the project include path 
Add libssh2/win32 to the project include path 
Add the appropriate crypto libraries to the project Additonal Libraries list 
Build 
Job done 

Steps above taken from https://www.libssh2.org/mail/libssh2-devel-archive-2012-09/0029.shtml
The libssh2 was linked to openssl during compilation. 
Link your project to the latest build you've just done for libssh2 and use the method 
libssh2_userauth_publickey_frommemory(LIBSSH2_SESSION *session, const char *username, size_t username_len, const char *publickeyfiledata, size_t publickeyfiledata_len, const char *privatekeyfiledata, size_t privatekeyfiledata_len, const char *passphrase);

And that's it.

Mono doesn't support persisting a private key to a certificate store.

this interesting discussion.

        certificate[0] = new CK_ATTRIBUTE(PKCS11Constants.CKA_CLASS, PKCS11Constants.CKO_CERTIFICATE);

        certificate[6] = new CK_ATTRIBUTE(PKCS11Constants.CKA_ISSUER, cert.getIssuerX500Principal().getEncoded());
        certificate[7] = new CK_ATTRIBUTE(PKCS11Constants.CKA_SERIAL_NUMBER, cert.getSerialNumber().toByteArray());

        try {
            certificate[8] = new CK_ATTRIBUTE(PKCS11Constants.CKA_VALUE, cert.getEncoded());
            p11.C_CreateObject(hSession, certificate);

            logger.log(Level.SEVERE, ""Upload Certificate Exception"", e);
            return false;
        }

        X509PublicKeyCertificate pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate = new X509PublicKeyCertificate();

        pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate.getToken().setBooleanValue(Boolean.TRUE);

        pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate.getIssuer().setByteArrayValue(cert.getIssuerX500Principal().getEncoded());
        // serial number should be an DER encoded ASN.1 integer
        /*
         INTEGER asn1Integer = new INTEGER(userCertificate.getSerialNumber());
         ByteArrayOutputStream buffer = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
         DerCoder.encodeTo(asn1Integer, buffer);
         pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate.getSerialNumber().setByteArrayValue(buffer.toByteArray());
         */
        // Netscape deviates from the standard here, for use with Netscape rather use
        pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate.getSerialNumber().setByteArrayValue(cert.getSerialNumber().toByteArray());
        pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate.getValue().setByteArrayValue(cert.getEncoded());

        session.createObject(pkcs11X509PublicKeyCertificate);

The ID of the certificate object should be the same as the ID of generated keys.

","I think you are confusing symetric and asymetric encryption. When doing symetric encryption you can use the same key. In asymetric encryption you have two keys. A public key with which you can encrypt your passwords, but you can't decrypt them with this key. This is only possible with the private key.
Therefore you don't need to share a key between those tools. Like the name suggests the private key should never leave you system.

When you use a private key to encrypt something you will need the corresponding public key to decrypt.
If you really want to do this then you can put the path to the public key into the properties file also.

Also, as dasblinkenlight noted, make a password decryptable yields some security issues so test if you can design your application different...

I am very new in data encryption. Trying it for the first time..
I am working on a tool which is basically run using script. The code will be kept on secured server where very few people have access.

So if any one else try to configure properties file they should not be able to figure out the password. As there are there will be three different loging credential will be there for three differnt sources. And respective admins will configure them from the same file.

","I think your main concern is sharing the key between applications.
In my opinion, the best way to do this would be to use a Public-Private Keypair. You could distribute the public key and keep your private key safe.
If several apps are used to generate passwords, then use the public key to encrypt.
If one app generates the password and several apps use it then you could encrypt with private key and all your other apps can use their bundled public key to decrypt the password.
Point is, once you have figured out your keypair distribution, you could you either public or private to encrypt or decrypt depending on how the application is designed.
Please refer Beginning Crypto examples for more details on how to create keypair and encrypt/decrypt data.

There are various ways of doing this. jSSLutils is a library that can make it a bit more convenient (but you could also do it more manually). There's an example with the FixedServerAliasKeyManager. One of the shortest ways to do it would be to use something like this:
X509SSLContextFactory sslContextFactory = new X509SSLContextFactory();
// By default, this would use the keystore passed with the usual system properties.

sslContextFactory.setKeyManagerWrapper(
    new FixedServerAliasKeyManager.Wrapper(""the-alias-you-want""));
// You could read the alias name from a custom system property, for example.

Currently I have a class with a static object of the Cipher class which I initialise like this: myCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, ivParameterSpec);.
Now my question is: I have two-way communication, should I have a separate Cipher object for each way (one for encrypting and one for decrypting) and use the same initialisation vector? Or should I just use the same object and call Cipher.init() to change the modes depending on whether I am encrypting or decrypting?
It makes sense to have separate objects in my head, but I just wanted to be sure. I tried googling but most examples only show encryption one way.
Currently I send the initialisation vector to the server unencrypted, is this correct, or is there a security flaw?
Or am I approaching it completely the wrong way?

","Your question is two fold:

You should use one object. This saves memory. But if memory is spendable, go ahead with two. At least that'll make your code more readable.
IV needs not encrypted. IV is a random value, sync'd by both the sender and receiver. The most important thing about IV is it must not be repeated, or re-used, with the same key!

I gave a certificate to the server crt.crt, i think i need to encrypt with my private key, and then they will be able to decrypt the message, with a key from the certificate, that is what i understood.

"49057905","Calculating d value in RSA","I saw a couple questions about this but most of them were answered in unhelpful way or didn't get a proper answer at all.  I have these variables:

p = 31
q = 23
e - public key exponent = 223
phi - (p-1)*(q-1) = 660


Now I need to calculate d variable (which I know is equal 367). The problem is that I don't know how. I found this equation on the internet but it doesn't work (or I can't use it):
e⋅d=1modϕ(n)

When I see that equation i think that it means this:
d=(1modϕ(n))/e

But apparently it doesn't because 367 (1modϕ(n))/e = 1%660/223 = 1/223 != 367
 Maybe I don't understand and I did something wrong - that's why I ask.
I did some more research and I found second equation:
d=1/e mod ϕ(n)
or
d=e^-1 mod ϕ(n)

But in the end it gives the same result:
1/e mod ϕ(n) = 1/223 % 660 = 1/223 != 367
Then I saw some guy saying that to solve that equation you need extended Euclidean algorithm If anyone knows how to use it to solve that problem then I'd be very thankful if you help me.
","If you want to calculate something like a / b mod p, you can't just divide it and take division remainder from it. Instead, you have to find such b-1 that b-1 = 1/b mod p (b-1 is a modular multiplicative inverse of b mod p). If p is a prime, you can use Fermat's little theorem. It states that for any prime p, ap = a mod p <=> a(p - 2) = 1/a mod p. So, instead of a / b mod p, you have to compute something like a * b(p - 2) mod p. b(p - 2) can be computed in O(log(p))
 using exponentiation by squaring. If p is not a prime, modular multiplicative inverse exists if and only if GCD(b, p) = 1. Here, we can use extended euclidean algorithm to solve equation bx + py = 1 in logarithmic time. When we have bx + py = 1, we can take it mod p and we have bx = 1 mod p <=> x = 1/b mod p, so x is our b-1. If GCD(b, p) ≠ 1, b-1 mod p doesn't exist.
Using either Fermat's theorem or the euclidean algorithm gives us same result in same time complexity, but the euclidean algorithm can also be used when we want to compute something modulo number that's not a prime (but it has to be coprime with numer want to divide by).

To underline: I want to remain on SSH-based password-less login, so any solutions that assume adding password to URL or permanently storing password in TortoiseGit configuration is not an option for me.
What I found out so far:

My problem is not related to GitHub; I don't use it in TortoiseGit and it happens on other remotes.
I do have SSH, not HTTPS, address as repo's URL and I don't have git clone-like stuff in it.
I can push/pull the same repository using Netbeans (and my Netbeans has Select Configured Git Repository Location option checked, so it uses the same remote configuration).
I can't push/pull remote using Git GUI, reason the same: asking for user password.
This is not related to a particular system or machine (SSH key), as it happens on both my work computer (32-bit Win 7) and home one (64-bit Win 7). Both of course uses different SSH key (see comment to this answer, which claims, that problem is related to 32-bit version of Windows; this is not true, it happens on 64-bit Windows as well).
Repository, this happens on, isn't empty -- I heard and even been personally affected, that sometimes TortoiseGit gets wako and asks for password on password-less login remote, until that remote is empty.
This is not related to a particular remote -- TortoiseGit works fine, without asking for password on some repositories (i.e. BitBucket) but ""dies"" asking for it on some other (i.e. in local dev network).

To make things even worse, there are certain remotes, on which TortoiseGit on my home computer fails, asking for password, while the very same remote accessed from home computer works just fine. And vice-versa. I set both machines for password-less login using the same steps; only SSH keys differs.
Things I did so far (and didn't solve the problem):

Changing SSH client (TortoiseGit -> Settings -> Network) to both Git\bin\ssh.exe (as suggested in here) and to C:\Program Files\PuTTy\plink.exe.
Using credential helper doesn't helped and I heard that it works for HTTPS only, not for SSL.
Downloading git-credential-wincred.exe and putting it to Git for Windows / msysgit folder didn't help as well; I've already had it there (different version / filesize; checked on both).
This issue is clearly bind to asking for user password, so git did not exit cleanly (exit code 128) error following it doesn't have any other source except missing password and most solutions given here, like crashed git, locked file, missing user e-mail are not solution for me.

OK, that's the farest point I've reached. And still nothing. Can anyone come up with something new, that I should try to solve this issue?
","I confirm that ""storing password"" or _netrc file, or any credential helpers are for https url only, and have nothing to do with SSH.
The usual debugging ssh steps apply, starting by making sure that %HOME% is defined when TortoiseGit is launched, and %HOME%/.ssh exists, and contains the default keys id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.
In a git bash session, you can do a ssh -Tvvv yourRemoteServer to see what the debug error message sequence is, as explained here.
You also can check the result of a GIT_TRACE=2 git push test master, to see if the issue is limited to TortoiseGit and if the verbose output leaves any clue (see here).
Try switching ssh client between putty and openssh to see if TortoiseGit fairs better with one or the other.

Currently I have my Tomcat web server configured to use client authentication.  I also have an ssl client accessing a keystore and successfully connecting to the web server.  However when trying to get IE 7 to successfully connect to the web server the methodology failed.  I did the following:  
I've created a pkcs12 file containing a private key as well as the associated digital certificate (it's currently self signed).  
I then went into IE Tools-Internet-Options-Content and imported the pkcs12 file into the personal certificate box.  When the browser attempts to make a connection with the web server, I get a popup message entitled ""Choose A Digital Certificate""  
HOWEVER the View-Certificate button is grayed out. I presume that this button should have allowed me to choose the certificate associated with the key-pair that I imported.  

Why is it grayed out?  
Is the methodology for what I'm trying to accomplish all together different?

","I'll now answer my own question as I have found the problem.
I did not yet update the web server trust store with the CA certificate (same certificate as it is self signed).  I finally did this but only out of desperation as my only aim at this point was to be able to choose a certificate but not necessarily have the connection succeed.
Evidently the handshake workflow is such that IE knows which certificates the web server will trust so that if there are no matches, no certificate option is shown.  I would have thought that IE would allow you to pick any certificate and if it was not trusted by the web server then the connection would simply fail.  Interesting.

Google does support two different ways to use this  as taking the key as java.io.File or java.security.PrivateKey and for PoC, I have used first way which is creating GoogleCredential object using the java.io.File,
        GoogleCredential credential = new GoogleCredential.Builder()
                .setTransport(httpTransport)
                .setJsonFactory(jsonFactory)

                .setServiceAccountPrivateKeyFromP12File(serviceAccountPrivateKeyFile)
                .build();

It's working as expected but in my actual use case i cannot rely on filesystem so i cannot use first method. So i wanted to implement actual use case using second way which is using java.security.PrivateKey and would look like following when its done.
    GoogleCredential credential = new GoogleCredential.Builder()
            .setTransport(httpTransport)
            .setJsonFactory(jsonFactory)
            .setServiceAccountId(serviceAccountId)

            .setServiceAccountUser(serviceAccountUser)
            .setServiceAccountPrivateKey(serviceAccountPrivateKey)
            .build();

Im my use case, i need make possible to upload the private key and store it in the database with base64 encoded. Now i need to pass that content of pkcs12 key and create the Googlecredential object. To do i think the second option is the most suited way, but couldn't find any example to create java.security.PrivateKey from the base64 encoded content of the uploaded key.
Is that possible to create java.security.PrivateKey object from a base64 encoded content of pkcs12 key?
Or is there any other way around to achieve my usecase?
Thanks in advance

","java.securty.KeyStore takes any InputStream for the load() method, so you could create this using whatever method you have of obtaining the .p12 bytes.  Here's an alternate method I used.  While this is still using a file for the .p12 bytes, you could bring in a ByteArrayInputStream or any InputStream subclass:
    private PrivateKey getPrivateKeyFromP12() {
        // Google p12 files all have ""notasecret"" as the pass and ""privatekey"" as the PK name
        String p12p = ""notasecret"";    // not cool!  Change this before exporting your .p12
        try {

I want SCP to happen without any user interaction. In nutshell, the problem seems to be Maven SCP not picking up the private key. 
","Let us take an example :
localuser $ ssh remoteuser@server.com
Now SCP or SSH using checks two things(considering public key authorization):

The private key of the using issuing the ssh command, usually ~/.ssh/id_rsa. In the example it would be /home/localuser/.ssh/id_rsa
The public key of the user, in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the user you are loggin in as. In our e.g. at remote server it would be /home/remoteuser/.ssh/authorized_keys

I don't know much about Maven config but it seems like you are trying to login as ABC user, in which case ABC user should have the key of your localuser in it's authorized_keys file

","P12 is is keystore type where multiple keys and certificates can be stored and a password can be used to protect them. You can search about P12 (PKCS12) on Internet. Your file is P12 file, so most likely it is PKCS12 format file.
To get private key from P12 file use below code. You need below things before calling this code.

filePath. String path (absolute) of P12 file.
filePassword. It is a char[]. Represents password of p12 file.
keyPassword. It is a char[]. Represents password for private key. Most
  likely it is same as filePassword.
alias. A String. Represents by which alias a private key stored in P12
  archive/keystore.

To check what is the alias of your private key you can use below command
keytool -list -v -keystore <yourfile>.p12 -storetype pkcs12

It will ask for password then print multiple lines. Look for 
Entry Type: PrivatKeyEntry

There you will find the alias.
Initialize these variables and then use below code to get private key. You can also get Certificates/Public key associate with this key. Look for API of PrivateKeyEntry 
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"");

","As outlined in this white paper on secure data encryption and its supporting material:

Use HTTPS.
For a second layer of authenticated encryption, use libsodium (a modern, cross-platfrom cryptography library) with pinned public keys.

PHP Example
Key Generation
$bob_box_kp = \Sodium\crypto_box_keypair();
$bob_box_secretkey = \Sodium\crypto_box_secretkey($bob_box_kp);
$bob_box_publickey = \Sodium\crypto_box_publickey($bob_box_kp);

Encryption
$anonymous_message_to_bob = \Sodium\crypto_box_seal(
    $message,
    $bob_box_publickey
);

Decryption
$decrypted_message = \Sodium\crypto_box_seal_open(
    $anonymous_message_to_bob,
    $bob_box_kp
);
if ($decrypted_message === false) {
    // You have the wrong keypair or the message was tampered with.
}

Android Example (using Libstodium)
Key Generation
byte[] secret_key = new byte[Box.SECRETKEYBYTES];
byte[] public_key = new byte[Box.PUBLICKEYBYTES];
Box.keypair(public_key, secret_key);

Encryption
Box.seal(
    ciphertextByteArray, // Output goes here
    plaintextByteArray,  // Your message
    public_key
);

Decryption
Box.sealOpen(

","Certificate is actually the block of information which binds your identity (i.e. your name, email, whatever else) to some public key. It is public so everyone can know that this key belongs to you.
So when you will sign something they will know that actually you signed this. 
The other thing is validating certificate - that's for what trusted root certificates are used.
Private key is your own secret information, and MUST be kept secret.

","A PKCS#12 file can contain both the certificate and the private key.  They are, however, stored as separate, distinct objects.  The certificate itself has the public key embedded within it.  Since the certificate only contains the public key, it is considered ""public"" as well.  You can feel free to distribute the certificate, as it does not contain the private key, which should be kept confidential.  This is the basis of the security in asymmetric cryptography.
Because a PKCS#12 file contains both items, it is encrypted with a password to protect the private key within it.  That said, you would use the private key to prove that the certificate you distribute belongs to you.  For example, through the use of a digital signature on a document.
Hope that helps!

ssh username: ec2-user
ssh password : my private key password
ssh keyfile /Users/me/.ssh/id_rsa   : this is my private key stored on my local machine

my public key is set on the server already and I can connect to the database through mysqlworkbench.
But i need to connect to this database using the private key I have, from another server through php. So i can make some queries and present them in html tables etc.
My guess is to create a php file on my server, 
store my private key somewhere on this server safely.
connect to database using the private key, db location, password etc.
I am asking the connection code I need in that php file. This is what I would use if the db was located on the local server
mysql_connect(""localhost"", ""root"", ""pass"") or die(mysql_error()) ;
mysql_select_db(""my_db"") or die(mysql_error()) ;

","If you wanna connect to the server remotely,use this command
ssh -i private_key_file.cert user@host

and then connect to your mysql using 
mysql -u user -p

which prompts you to insert your password.
Practically, when you're connected like this,you can do whatever you need.

DLLTest.exe: Microsoft C++ exception: CryptoPP::BERDecodeErr ...

You have a private exponent, and not a private key. So you should not call Load on it. That's causing the Crypto++ BERDecodeErr exception.
The answer is detailed on the ECDSA wiki page, but its not readily apparent. You need to perform the following to initialize the privateKey given the curve and exponent::
string exp = ""E4A6CFB431471CFCAE491FD566D19C87082CF9FA7722D7FA24B2B3F5669DBEFB"";
exp.insert(0, ""0x"");

Integer x(exp.c_str());
privateKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);

Prepending the ""0x"" ensures the Integer class will parse the ASCII string correctly. You can also append a ""h"" character to the string. You can see the parsing code for Integer class at Integer.cpp around line 2960 in the StringToInteger function.

Here's another way to do the same thing:
string exp = ""E4A6CFB431471CFCAE491FD566D19C87082CF9FA7722D7FA24B2B3F5669DBEFB"";

HexDecoder decoder;
decoder.Put((byte*)exp.data(), exp.size());
decoder.MessageEnd();

Integer x;
x.Decode(decoder, decoder.MaxRetrievable());

privateKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);

The HexDecoder will perform the ASCII to binary conversion for you. The buffer held by the HexDecoder will then be consumed by the Integer using its Decode (BufferedTransformation &bt, size_t inputLen, Signedness=UNSIGNED) method.

And here is another way using HexDecoder (Crypto++ is as bad as scripting languages at times :)...
string exp = ""E4A6CFB431471CFCAE491FD566D19C87082CF9FA7722D7FA24B2B3F5669DBEFB"";
StringSource ss(exp, true /*punpAll*/, new HexDecoder);

Integer x;
x.Decode(ss, ss.MaxRetrievable());

privateKey.Initialize(ASN1::secp256r1(), x);


After initializing the key, you should validate it:
bool result = privateKey.Validate( prng, 3 );
if( !result ) { /* Handle error */ }


This will output binary data:
cout << signature.data() << endl;

If you want something printable/readable, run it though a Crypto++ HexEncoder.

I have found a similar unanswered question on SO, but it is using un-managed code, whereas I am using the managed API, but both seems to be having the same root cause.
","We contacted Microsoft support for a solution and here is the response that we got:

Why is the private key not available when the code is executed on server2?
A: This is actually by design.  Certificate stores are different from private key storage.  While you can enumerate certificates remotely, private keys cannot be accessed remotely.  
Can this issue be fixed by giving the user extra privileges or by changes in group policy settings? 
A: No.  This doesn’t involve privileges or permission to the file.  
If not both of the above then can you suggest the suitable solution?
A: 1. You can install the certificate on all machines so each one has a copy of the private key.
            2. You can create a roaming domain user.  A roaming certificate is the only situation where private keys can be roamed between machines.
                 Roaming profiles are located on a server, when the user logs on, a temporary copy of the profile (including private key) is created.
             3. Use a third party cryptographic provider.  There are some cryptographic providers that do allow remote private key access and cryptographic operations.

require_once('path/to/cryptolib.php');
// Generate a token of 16 char with the library by calling the randomString method.
$token = CryptoLib::randomString(16);
// Generate a salt with the library by calling the generateSalt method
$salt = CryptoLib::generateSalt();
// Hash the token with the salt that was generated
$hash = CryptoLib::hash($token, $salt);

// Salt and hash are then stored in the database.

// $hash and $salt are gotten later from the database, and the token is provided via a POST variable by the user
$isHashCorrect = CryptoLib::validateHash($hash, $_POST['token']);

// If isHashCorrect is true, the user has provided the correct token.

"14133367","OpenSSL hanging when trying to encrypt","I am hoping there is someone here who knows something about OpenSSL. I am completely new to OpenSSL and I'm trying to implement it to encrypt dynamically generated PayPal buttons for a web store. I have a PHP script that does this, however it was not working, so I decided to try to run the command in command prompt and realized that it is hanging when I try to encrypt. 
I have generated a public certificate and a private key and also I have downloaded PayPal's public certificate.
This is the command I tried:
(openssl smime -sign -signer C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\my-pubcert.pem -inkey 
C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\my-prvkey.pem -outform der -nodetach -binary 
C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\DataToEncrypt.txt) | openssl smime -encrypt -des3 
-binary -outform pem C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\paypal_cert.pem

When I run this command I get the following message:
Loading 'screen' into random state -Loading 'screen' into random state -done done

At this point it hangs. Does anyone with any OpenSSL experience know why this is happening to me? Please keep in mind I have never used OpenSSL before so I might be overlooking something simple, which is why I hope someone can point me in the right direction.
I appreciate any suggestions! Thanks!
","You're missing an -in in the first half of the command, which is subsequently trying to read data from standard input (and thus hanging).
The correct command line should be 
openssl smime -sign -signer C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\my-pubcert.pem -inkey 
C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\my-prvkey.pem -outform der -nodetach -binary 
-in C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\DataToEncrypt.txt | openssl smime -encrypt -des3 
-binary -outform pem C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\OpenSSLTest\paypal_cert.pem

Notice the addition of -in to line 3.
Then DataToEncrypt.txt will be correctly read as an input file.

The problem is that even if I have both public and private keys I forgot the passphrase used whilst creating keys because right after that I've passed it to ssh-agent. But I still have it (the passphrase) stored in the ssh-agent in my laptop. How can I restore the passphrase from ssh-agent if I have root access and both keys?
","As far as I understand it, the passphrase is used to encrypt the private key. ssh-agent doesn't remember the passphrase - it remembers the decrypted private key.
And, as a damienfrancois mentioned, it shouldn't remember it past a reboot.
If you wished to extract the decrypted private keys from ssh-agent itself, you would have to find a tool written to search the memory of the running process and locate keys. One such tool can be found here, but you may well find it very challenging to use.
For a more practical answer, you can just delete your keys from ~/.ssh/id*, make new ones that you know the passphrase for, and move on - for a new machine, you probably haven't gotten too reliant on them yet.

","The whole point of the certificate is to establish a relationship between the private key and you as the identity in the certificate.

The CSR is signed by the private key and verified by the CA (with the public key in the CSR), so he knows you have that key pair.
So he verifies offline that you are who you say you are, own that domain, etc., then he signs it with his private key.
So then if a third party trusts him, he can trust what the certificate says, which is that its owner is who it says.
Then if he can establish that the peer he is talking to owns that certificate, via another signature in the SSL handshake using your private key, he knows that the peer is you.

","Like @chris said, there is no way to change the key associated with the instance. You will need to launch a new one with the new key assigned to it. 
BUT If SSH access is what you need, don't bother trying to change or update the key associated with the instance. It has been a while since I stopped assigning keys to instances over allowing OpsWorks manage user access in the permissions section. 
This gives you great flexibility because you don't need to share keys amongst users or start new instances every time you need to change or set a new SSH key. You can add or remove users any time, and you control who has SSH and/or Sudo access.
To start either grant one of your users access to OpsWorks or import IAM users: 

After access has been granted, ask the user to add their own public key in the ""My Settings"" > Edit page:


If you gave this user access to SSH all you have to do is wait for the recipes to finish running and the user will be able to connect to the instance like this:
 $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/[your-key-file] [user-name]@[instance-ip-address]

Note that any time you make changes to the permissions or settings section, recipes will be run in your instances updating the user access.

When I tried the solution of security import pub.pem -k login.keychain, it said 1 key imported., but it doesn't show on Keychain Access.

Am I missing anything?
Should I not bother with transferring the public key?
Is importing just that private key enough?
Is the only way just recovering the public key from the private key?

Thanks
","According to this, it looks like when running the security import... command, it's added to the keychain with the generic name Imported Public Key.
Now you just need to rename it to the relevant one (e.g. like the private key name).

"39634920","how to get private key from exponent , modulus and private exponent in PHP?","im new in PHP Crypto and im using openssl to do crypto operations. 
Openssl Rsa is need PEM format , but i have hexadecimal modulus(n) , private exponent(d) and public exponent (e).
How can i generate Private key from this components?
And sorry for my english.
","RSA private keys usually also have a bunch of other parameters too. The primes that were used to create the modulus (p and q) and other parameters to facilitate the use of the Chinese remainder theorem to speed up decryption. If you don't have that then I'd just create a public key. You might be able to replace PUBLIC with PRIVATE idk.
Anyway, here's some code (uses phpseclib 1.0.3):
<?php
include('Crypt/RSA.php');
include('Math/BigInteger.php');

$rsa = new Crypt_RSA();
$rsa->loadKey([
    'e' => new Math_BigInteger('...'), // base-10 by default
    'n' => new Math_BigInteger('...') // base-10 by default
]);

echo $rsa;

I used 15 as both e and n (which isn't actually a valid combo for RSA purposes but for demo purposes it's fine) and got this back:

","As James K Polk comments on the question, openssl doesn't support generating keys in this manner. You'll have to write a program yourself to do this.
For example, the following Java code would work. You'll need to handle the exceptions as well.
BigInteger modulus = /* modulus here */;

","The problem was in the FileOutputStream was pointing to the wrong file.

Should be using the getFile2 method like this:
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(getFile2(Constants.JKS_PRIVATE_FILE_NAME));

As Palamino pointed out, don't need to include true in the FileOutputStream constructor.
Also the key store should have been using the JKS file password, not the password that is generated by getKeyPassword().
Changed this: 
keyStore.store(out, pass);

Another possibility is that I'm using the incorrect argument in crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');. I'm not sure what I should use instead.

Is My solution wrong?

That depends on your requirements and threat model. The signature generation of RSACryptoServiceProvider should be explicitly set to a hash other than MD5 or SHA-1. It's not clear from your question if this has taken place.

If I use this method to import keys
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tswxhw92(v=vs.110).aspx
GetKeyFromContainer(""MyKeyContainer"");
Is MyKeyContainer private and public keys static?

Yes, that's the general idea of using a key store anyway.

At each run, Can I have same private key/public key? Or should I have different key set each time I generate a signature?

Yes you can, given that you use an ample key size, say 2048 bit or higher.

Actually, for your solution to be secure the receiver needs to trust the public key. When no trust is established, anybody could send you their public key instead.

","The easy answer is, use TLS.
If you've implemented your server interface as a web API, then this is as simple as configuring your web server front-end to accept connections over HTTPS.  Your web server (and the browser / HTTPS client library on the client side) will then take care of most of the complicated handshaking, authentication and encryption details for you.
TLS is far from a perfect security protocol, but if used properly, it generally does the job, and it does it with much less hassle or opportunities for mistakes than designing your own protocol would.

If you really want to ""roll your own"" secure communications scheme, you're first going to have to familiarize yourself with the theory of cryptography and the various available algorithms.  In particular, to implement an effective hybrid cryptosystem, you're going to need:

an authenticated public-key based key agreement protocol (preferably something based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and thus providing forward secrecy) to provide the client and server with a temporary shared key;
an authenticated symmetric encryption algorithm, to provide a secure channel between the client and the server using the shared key; and
if the data is transmitted as discrete messages within the secure channel, a communications protocol capable of detecting message replay attacks (e.g. through the use of sequential message numbers).

While all of these can be implemented using only a few discrete crypto primitives — a block cipher (e.g. AES), a public-key encryption/signature algorithm (e.g. RSA), and possibly a hash function (e.g. SHA-256) and some way to do modular exponentiation for Diffie–Hellman — it's generally easier to use protocols and schemes that you crypto library already implements a high-level interface for.
Unfortunately, the most widely implemented schemes also tend to be the older ones, which may be slower and have weaker security guarantees than more modern schemes.  That said, if I had the choice (and keep in mind that I'm by no means a true crypto expert), here's what I'd pick:

If the client needs to authenticate itself using a password, I'd pick SRP for the key agreement protocol.  If both sides have public signature keys known to the other, the problem is somewhat simpler, and could be handled simply by using raw Diffie–Hellman and then having both parties sign the D–H shared secret, or by using something like STS.  (Note that, even with SRP, you may still want the server to authenticate itself to the client using something stronger than just knowledge of the client's password verifier.)
For the signature algorithm, any of RSA (with proper padding), DSA or ECDSA should do, as long as the key length is sufficient.  (What counts as sufficient depends on the algorithm.)  Where hash algorithms are required, I would, for now, use SHA-2; once the SHA-3 standard is finalized, it should also be a valid choice.
For the symmetric encryption part, I'd go with SIV (RFC 5297) for maximum fool-proofness, or with GCM if speed is critical or ""on-line"" encryption of large messages is required (and you don't have to implement it yourself).  OCB could also be an option, if the patent exemptions are enough for your purposes, and EAX is perfectly good too, if not the absolute fastest.  See also How to choose an Authenticated Encryption mode.
Generic composition of a block cipher (e.g. in CTR mode) and a MAC would also work, as long you make sure to apply the MAC to the message after encryption (end verify it before decryption).  Any decent MAC should do, but HMAC is generally a safe and robust choice, if you have a good hash function available and don't need extreme speed.  (If you do, a fast Carter–Wegman MAC like poly1305-AES may be worth considering.) Try to avoid the old CBC-MAC if you can; CMAC is much better.
In any case, I see no good reason to choose anything other than AES for the underlying block cipher at the moment, although it's always good to design your protocol so that new cipher options may be easily introduced (and old insecure ones deprecated) in the future.
To derive the symmetric encryption key(s) from the D–H / SRP shared secret, you'll generally need a key derivation function; HKDF (RFC 5869) is a good choice for this job, especially if you already use a hash function anyway.  (It shouldn't be used — alone, at least — for hashing passwords, though; for that, you need a key-stretching KDF like PBKDF2 or scrypt.)
Also, as noted, I would design my communications protocol so that all messages carry a sequential message number and explicit sender/receiver designations, and so that messages with duplicate message numbers or invalid designations are discarded as forgeries.  Conveniently, these message numbers + designators can also be used as nonces for the symmetric encryption protocol (possibly after hashing, if they would otherwise be too long).
These message numbers and designators don't necessarily have to be encrypted (although they do need to be authenticated as ""associated data""); not encrypting them has the advantage that you can immediately reject any messages with bogus numbers or designators, even before attempting decryption.
Finally, always keep in mind that there may be exploitable gaps in what I've suggested above, or in the way you choose to apply my suggestions.  Make sure to get as many competent security experts as possible to review your protocol and implementation before you use it for anything actually important.

As for specific crypto libraries or APIs in the various languages you mention, I'm not particularly familiar with those, and thus cannot offer detailed advice.  Just look at the documentation of standard crypto libraries and see what they offer.

We have not been able to come up with a reliable way of reproducing the issue. Several articles mention possible states that can cause the Keystore to ""forget"" a Key or become locked such as here. However, as far as I can tell we have not fallen into any of these edge cases. It seems to happen after letting the device sit for a while after the first setup of the key. We have seen this happen across multiple emulators and devices, ranging from  21 to 26. Additionally these devices have used either swipe to unlock or a PIN. Changing the PIN or security method does not seem to cause the issue. Again, this issue seems to occur after the device has been sitting unused for several days. 
I have found two other SOs here and here as well as one Google issue. If I'm understanding correctly, the answer linked in both seems to rely upon the premise that the caller has called setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds when creating the Key, and we have not done so. Additionally the given solution seems to rely upon just deleting the key and generating a new one. 
Below is our setup for the key on for versions >= API 23. I've left out our key generation for versions older than 23, since we've primarily seen this on APIs >= 23. 
private static final int RSA_KEY_SIZE = 2048;
private static final String CERT_SUBJECT_STRING = ""CN=<COMPANY_NAME> Android App O=<COMPANY_NAME>"";
private static final String ANDROID_KEY_STORE = ""AndroidKeyStore"";

try {
        String alias = KEY_NAME;
        KeyPairGenerator generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_RSA, ANDROID_KEY_STORE);

        Calendar start = Calendar.getInstance();
        Calendar end = Calendar.getInstance();
        end.add(Calendar.YEAR, 1);
        KeyGenParameterSpec spec = new KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(alias, KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT | KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT)
            .setAlgorithmParameterSpec(new RSAKeyGenParameterSpec(RSA_KEY_SIZE, RSAKeyGenParameterSpec.F4))
            .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_RSA_PKCS1)
            .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_ECB)
            .setCertificateNotAfter(end.getTime())
            .setCertificateNotBefore(start.getTime())
            .setCertificateSerialNumber(BigInteger.ONE)
            .setCertificateSubject(new X500Principal(CERT_SUBJECT_STRING))
            .build();
        generator.initialize(spec);
        generator.generateKeyPair();
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException | NoSuchProviderException | InvalidAlgorithmParameterException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

We then attempt to access the keys later via keyStore.getEntry(KEY_NAME, null). Again, this works for a while, but then will begin to throw the above exception.
","I also faced issues with stability in KeyStore.
The solution was to use for private key
PrivateKey privKey = ks.getKey(alias, password)


And this to public key
PublicKey pubKey = ks.getCertificate(alias).getPublicKey();

instead of getEntry
ks.getEntry(alias, password)

The problem wasn't in the way you're creating the key but the way you're reading it.
Over more than a year never saw this issue again.

I want to do the signatures on client, due to the fact of not sending away the user's private key. This key (in theory) must be always with the user and it must not be sent to the web (even if protected with SSL, for example).
I want that every platform may be able to sign the documents. I've already developed a Java Applet with the signing algorithms, but Java is not supported in iOS or Android.. In .NET is impossible too. So I think I'm restricted to JavaScript, but I'm not aware of any javascript library that signs XML, PDF and Office documents.. What should I do? Only with Javascript every platform works..
Can u help me?
Regards,
William.
","Disclosure: I work for CoSign.
The solution is to use a secure, hardware hardened digital signature appliance.
You're raising the common question of digitally signing data at the network ""edge.""
Good luck on the idea of signing at the client/edge, for the reasons that you discuss. And forget Javascript, it is completely insecure from the cryptography point of view. 
You're right that the signers' private key shouldn't be sent anywhere. 
Good news: there is an alternative architecture that will:

Not require that the private keys be sent anywhere
Protect the private keys
Enable signing from clients of all types including mobile, Android, .Net, iOS, etc.
Decrease administrative costs by centralizing the keys and key management

The answer: use a centralized signing appliance. The appliance is hardened at the hardware level: if you try to open the box, the keys are destroyed. Signing appliances are made by my company and some others. 
In this system, the document (or better, just its hash) is sent from the edge device to the centralized signing appliance. The user also authenticates with the appliance (using any one of a number of techniques). The appliance holds the private keys. It signs the hash, and returns the digital signature to the edge client. 
Depending on the capabilities of the client, it can:
Assemble the signed document itself (combining the digital signature with the source document). Benefit: less data needs to be sent between the edge client and the signing appliance. Issue: requires more sw on the client. Or:
The appliance can return the complete signed document. Benefit simpler implementation on the client but requires that the document be sent to the signing appliance from the edge client.
Note that an entire PDF document doesn't have to be sent back--the PDF digital signature is simply appended to the source document. So the flow can be:

Send the entire PDF for signing. (Or just send the hash if the client can calculate it.)
Receive back either the entire PDF (signed), or just a ""tail"" that, when appended to the source PDF creates the signed document.

Multiple data types
My company supports signing of PDF, Word, Excel, XML and other document types out of the box. Eg Word documents are signed using the Word ""standard"" -- a digitally signed Word document can be verified by a recipient (relying party) without installing anything beyond Word. No plugins, etc.
Signer Authentication
Signers need to authenticate themselves with the centralized appliance. My company supports multiple types of authentication including OTP and 2FA.

"18165932","Save RSA PublicKey / PrivateKey safely","I create and use RSA public/private key to encrypt/decrypt some message.I store them to a sharedpreferences as string and when i need them i create from string. Everything is works perfectly, but is it secure to store my private key in sharedpreferences as string.
With this question :
SharedPreferences MODE_PRIVATE security
I learned that, someone can reach my sharedpreferences and can generate my private key from string. What can i do to make my private key secure while save it on my phone?
","It all depends on the the level of sensitivity of the private/public key pair. I think, storing them in a sharedpreferences is not a bad idea. Your key pair is stored relative to the app directory and has system protection from external access. But, as the word ""shared""Preferences implied, your key pair shared among your app components. So, if you need a better protection, consider storing the key pair in the KeyStore class instead . As of now, it is the best solution for key pair protection. It provides you password based key protection.
Update: There is a great article on android keystore and keychain usage here.

","Using openssl rsa to dump the key contents reveals that the private and public keys you posted above have a different modulus.  For a matching keypair, the modulus would be identical in the private and public keys.  In other words, you definately mixed up different keys there.
To detect this, OpenSSL proper has the RSA_check_key() function to check whether an RSA keypair is usable, but the PHP wrapper for OpenSSL does not seem to expose that function to the user.

I would appreciate any guidance, advice, or assistance in helping me get this resolved.
","What you asked for:
The NullReferenceException is caused by your exception handler in DecodeRSAPrivateKey returning null, but the caller not checking for it.
Your decode needs to be adjusted a bit for DER encoding vs CAPI encoding concerns (.NET has inherited the CAPI encoding restrictions):
1) The leading byte of Modulus must not be 0x00.  (DER requires it to be inserted if the next byte is >= 0x80).  So if it's there, you need to trim it out.
2) The leading byte of Exponent must not be 0x00.  Probably not an issue since your exponent is probably [ 0x01, 0x00, 0x01 ], but it doesn't hurt to code defensively.
3) D must be exactly the same length as Modulus.  If D is too short you need to pad it (on ""the left"") with 0x00-values.  If it's one byte too long and starts with 0x00, remove the 0x00.
4) P.Length = (Modulus.Length + 1) / 2.  (RSA-1024 has Modulus.Length 128 and P.Length 64.  RSA-1032 has Modulus.Length 129 and P.Length 65).  Left pad with 0x00 as necessary.  If P is one byte too long and it starts with 0x00, remove the 0x00. (If it's too long still, then CAPI (and therefore .NET) cannot read this key from parameters; P and Q aren't of similar lengths)
5) Q.Length, DP.Length, DQ.Length, and InverseQ.Length must all equal P.Length.  Left pad with 0x00 as necessary, remove a leading 0x00 as necessary.
You also seem to be reading BEGIN PRIVATE KEY files (PKCS#8), but you're interpreting it like BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY (PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey).  So you need to account for the header portions in the PrivateKeyInfo structure (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208#section-5).
What you might want instead:
If you're really reading a PKCS#8, and you're on .NET Framework 4.6 or higher, just let CngKey and RSACng do the work for you:
RSA LoadKeyFile(string filename)
{
    using (System.IO.FileStream fs = System.IO.File.OpenRead(filename))
    {
        byte[] data = new byte[fs.Length];
        byte[] res = null;
        fs.Read(data, 0, data.Length);
        if (data[0] != 0x30)
        {
            res = GetPem(""PRIVATE KEY"", data);
        }

        try
        {
            using (CngKey key = CngKey.Import(res, CngKeyBlobFormat.Pkcs8PrivateBlob))
            {
                return new RSACng(key);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""ex :"" + ex);
        }

        return null;
    }
}

Then you just need to change your calling code to stop caring that it got an RSACryptoServiceProvider, just that it's RSA:
public string RSASign(string data, string PhysicalApplicationPath)
{
    RSA rsa = LoadCertificateFile(PhysicalApplicationPath);
    byte[] dataBytes = System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetBytes(data);
    byte[] signatureBytes = rsa.SignData(dataBytes, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);
    return BitConverter.ToString(signatureBytes).Replace(""-"", null);
}

I left it as PKCS1 signature padding since that's what RSACryptoServiceProvider's method would have done.

"55949510","Casting private key to RSACryptoServiceProvider not working","I have a X509Certificate2 variable and I'm trying to cast the private key of the variable to a RSACryptoServiceProvider
RSACryptoServiceProvider pkey = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)cert.PrivateKey;

However I get this exception.

System.InvalidCastException: 'Unable to cast object of type 'System.Security.Cryptography.RSACng' to type 'System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider'.'

It's weird that this happens because other answers in SO suggested the same procedure as mine but I get an exception. Any solutions to this?
","So after a few tries and discussions in the comments I came up with the following solution.
            RSA rsa = (RSA)cert.PrivateKey;
        (cert.PrivateKey as RSACng).Key.SetProperty(
            new CngProperty(
                ""Export Policy"",
                BitConverter.GetBytes((int)CngExportPolicies.AllowPlaintextExport),
                CngPropertyOptions.Persist));

        RSAParameters RSAParameters = rsa.ExportParameters(true);                      

        AsymmetricCipherKeyPair keypair = DotNetUtilities.GetRsaKeyPair(RSAParameters);

The problem was that the variable rsa wasn't exportable. To change this I set a new CngProperty for the export policy. Works perfectly now

","By default the public key is not converted.
BUT you can export it by adding argument -pubkey
openssl x509 -inform der -in hostname.cer -out hostname.pem -pubkey

will give you a PEM file as following :

My expectation was to have an exception , have you any idea about it? Is it my validation wrong?

The key is malformed. First, save the PEM encoded key:
echo '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEowIBAAKCAQEA2lKPRVgFN8TfOhex+IJ6YMKUKeZgHZUGsJpHo/ipeYVeWUGa
...
iAc48q1o36aAYVSyY/JLR3Q9Su97+i55Ud5rDYW5ThLcACsjxB/mL
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----' > key.pem

Second, convert it to DER. This strips the first and last lines, and then base64 decodes it:
sed '$d' < key.pem | sed ""1d"" | openssl base64 -d > key.der

Third, examine the key with another tool:
$ dumpasn1 key.der

The sequence is supposed to have 1187 content octets. But that is impossible because there are only 1152 bytes in the file:

","In your commands you listed you are connecting to an EC2 server over SSH, then you are running the mongo client application to connect to the local MongoDB database. This is not the way your application is going to connect to your database.
Is your application running on AWS? If it is, then you will need to configure security groups to allow access to MongoDB. If it is running on the same server as the database then you don't even need to deal with security groups, you just need to give it the port that MongoDB is running on.
If your application isn't running on AWS, but needs to connect to a MongoDB instance on AWS, then you can either open the MongoDB port (default 27017) to your remote application (via security groups), or you can use SSH tunneling.

"45997841","How to get a SecIdentityRef from a SecCertificateRef and a SecKeyRef","Here's what I've already tried:
First idea was, just put both into an array, use that array with kSecUseItemList, so keychain calls will operate only on the items in this array, not on real keychains and then get the identity like this:
NSDictionary * searchQuery = @{
    (__bridge id)kSecClass:(__bridge id)kSecClassIdentity,
    (__bridge id)kSecUseItemList:@[(__bridge id)key, (__bridge id)cert],
    (__bridge id)kSecReturnRef:@YES
};
CFTypeRef foundItem = NULL;
OSStatus copyStatus = SecItemCopyMatching(
    (__bridge CFDictionaryRef)searchQuery, &foundItem
);

Turned out that this doesn't work. To quote from the docs:

@constant kSecUseItemList 
      Specifies a dictionary key whose value is a
      CFArray of items. If provided, this array is treated as the set of
      all possible items to search, or add if the API being called is
      SecItemAdd. The items in this array may be of type SecKeyRef,
      SecCertificateRef, SecIdentityRef, or CFDataRef (for a persistent
      item reference.) The items in the array must all be of the same
      type. When this attribute is provided, no keychains are searched.

Well, they are not of the same type, so this cannot work.
My second attempt was to add both items to keychain (using SecItemAdd()), which works as expected, then find the certificate (using SecItemCopyMatching()) which also succeeds and finally getting my identity using:
SecIdentityRef identity = NULL;
OSStatus copyStatus = SecIdentityCreateWithCertificate(NULL, cert, &identity);

But that fails with errKCItemNotFound. 
Looking at the items in Keychain Access app, the certificate and the private key are both there, they are both correct but they are not displayed as forming an Identity (they are not listed under ""My Certificates"", the cert is only listed under ""Certificates"" and the key under ""Keys"").
Okay, what am I doing wrong or what important step am I missing?
If I export the key to PKCS#8 and the cert to DER notation, then use openssl on command line to combine both into a PKCS#12 file and import that file with Keychain Access, then they are displayed as an Identity in keychain access and this identity also works correctly (so the private key is really the correct key for the public key in the cert). But this is not really an option, as my code must not rely on OpenSSL and would ideally be portable to iOS.
As far as I understood the documentation, the identity matching is done by matching public key hashes, so that could be related to my problem. How would the system know the hash of the public key for me SecKeyRef, which is only a raw private RSA key? 
The docs also say that I can add a SecIdentityRef directly with SecAddItem(), in which case I guess everything would probably work as expected (the identity itself cannot be added, the cert and the private key will be added, but I assume the identity binding will be okay when adding them that way), but that sounds like a chicken-egg-problem, since how would I get that identity reference in the first place?
I cannot understand why there is no SecCreateIdentity(...) function that simply takes a SecCertificateRef and SecKeyRef on input and returns a SecIdentityRef on output.

Update
Here's some interesting info I found in SecKey.h:

@constant kSecKeyLabel type blob, for private and public keys
      this contains the hash of the public key.  This is used to
      associate certificates and keys.  Its value matches the value
      of the kSecPublicKeyHashItemAttr of a certificate and it's used
      to construct an identity from a certificate and a key.
      For symmetric keys this is whatever the creator of the key
      passed in during the generate key call.

This value is not correctly set. The public key in the certs hashes to 0x966C57... but my private key contains 0x097EAD... and this looks like the hash of the private key itself. I will try if I can somehow set this value to the correct one.

Update 2
That seems to be another dead end. When I try to set kSecAttrApplicationLabel with SecKeyUpdate() on a key prior to adding it to keychain, I get errKCItemNotFound, which is expected, as the documentation says:

A SecKeyRef instance that represents a key that is stored in a keychain
    can be safely cast to a SecKeychainItemRef for manipulation as a 
    keychain  item. On the other hand, if the key is not stored in a 
    keychain, casting  the object to a SecKeychainItemRef and passing
    it to Keychain Services functions returns errors.

Fair enough. So I first add the key, then retrieve it back from keychain and finally try to update kSecAttrApplicationLabel, but this fails as well, this the error is errKCNoSuchAttr.
Oh, in case anyone wonders why I'm updating kSecAttrApplicationLabel when I said the attribute is named kSecKeyLabel in my first update: The kSecKeyLabel is an enumeration value of the old attribute enumerations that Apple used with various API calls that have all been deprecated. The new API calls (like SecItemUpdate()) work with dictionaries and as using enum values as dictionary keys is a bit ugly, Apple defined a new set of dictionary keys that are CFStringRef.

@constant kSecAttrApplicationLabel Specifies a dictionary key 
    whose value is the key's application label attribute. 
    This is different from the kSecAttrLabel (which is intended to be
    human-readable). This attribute is used to look up a key 
    programmatically;  in particular, for keys of class
    kSecAttrKeyClassPublic and kSecAttrKeyClassPrivate, 
    the value of this attribute is the hash of the public key. 
    This item is a type of CFDataRef.
    Legacy keys may contain a UUID in this field as a CFStringRef.

So this seems to be the correct attribute to update, doesn't it? Except that the error implies no such attribute exists for the item. Even though the same header file explicitly lists this attribute as a possible attribute for SecKeyRef items:

kSecClassKey item attributes:
              kSecAttrAccess (OS X only)
              kSecAttrAccessControl
              kSecAttrAccessGroup 
              (iOS; also OS X if kSecAttrSynchronizable specified)
              kSecAttrAccessible 
              (iOS; also OS X if kSecAttrSynchronizable specified)
              kSecAttrKeyClass
              kSecAttrLabel
              kSecAttrApplicationLabel
               [... and so on ...]


Update 3
The first answer I got suggested to use SecItemCopyMatching() instead, however, please understand that this code:
CFTypeRef result = NULL;
OSStatus status = SecItemCopyMatching(
    (__bridge CFDictionaryRef)@{
        (__bridge id)kSecClass:(__bridge id)kSecClassIdentity,
        (__bridge id)kSecMatchItemList:@[(__bridge id)cert],
        (__bridge id)kSecReturnRef:@YES
     }, &result
);

is really functional identical to his code:
SecIdentityRef result = NULL;
OSStatus status = SecIdentityCreateWithCertificate(
    NULL, cert &result
);

The later one is just the older API call (older, but not deprecated) from the time where keychain access was limited to working with Sec...Ref CoreFoundation ""objects"" (Apple's attempt to mimic a bit of OO in pure C), whereas the first one is the newer API where you usually only work with dictionary representation of keychain items (as that casts toll-free to Obj-C, you just need some bridging casts when you use ARC) but where you also have the choice to fall back to CoreFoundation ""objects"" (when using attributes like e.g. kSecMatchItemList, kSecUseItemList, or kSecReturnRef). I'm' actually rather sure that in fact there's just one real API and the other one is just implemented on top of the other one (depending which one on top of which one, the newer one may just exist for convenience or the older one was just kept for backward compatibility).
","The trick is to export the in-memory key first and then re-import it directly to the keychain instead of just adding it there. See the code below (careful, it's C++):
static OSStatus AddKeyToKeychain(SecKeyRef privateKey, SecKeychainRef targetKeychain)
{
    // This is quite similar to pal_seckey's ExportImportKey, but
    // a) is used to put something INTO a keychain, instead of to take it out.
    // b) Doesn't assume that the input should be CFRelease()d and overwritten.
    // c) Doesn't return/emit the imported key reference.
    // d) Works on private keys.
    SecExternalFormat dataFormat = kSecFormatWrappedPKCS8;
    CFDataRef exportData = nullptr;

    SecItemImportExportKeyParameters keyParams = {};
    keyParams.version = SEC_KEY_IMPORT_EXPORT_PARAMS_VERSION;
    keyParams.passphrase = CFSTR(""ExportImportPassphrase"");

    OSStatus status = SecItemExport(privateKey, dataFormat, 0, &keyParams, &exportData);

    SecExternalFormat actualFormat = dataFormat;
    SecExternalItemType actualType = kSecItemTypePrivateKey;
    CFArrayRef outItems = nullptr;

    if (status == noErr)
    {
        status =
            SecItemImport(exportData, nullptr, &actualFormat, &actualType, 0, &keyParams, targetKeychain, &outItems);
    }

    if (exportData != nullptr)
        CFRelease(exportData);

    CFRelease(keyParams.passphrase);
    keyParams.passphrase = nullptr;

    if (outItems != nullptr)
        CFRelease(outItems);

    return status;
}

The later one is just the older API call (older, but not deprecated) from the time where keychain access was limited to working with Sec...Ref CoreFoundation ""objects"" (Apple's attempt to mimic a bit of OO in pure C), whereas the first one is the newer API where you usually only work with dictionary representation of keychain items (as that casts toll-free to Obj-C, you just need some bridging casts when you use ARC) but where you also have the choice to fall back to CoreFoundation ""objects"" (when using attributes like e.g. kSecMatchItemList, kSecUseItemList, or kSecReturnRef). I'm' actually rather sure that in fact there's just one real API and the other one is just implemented on top of the other one (depending which one on top of which one, the newer one may just exist for convenience or the older one was just kept for backward compatibility).
","The answer from @bartonjs really solves my problem, I just want to provide some extra helpful information here, as it is not very obvious why it solves the problem:
First of all, please note that security objects can either exist only in memory or they can exist in memory backed up by keychain storage. Every security object has data (the actual data that defines the object) and metadata (additional information that describes the data). But only objects backed up by keychain storage can have metadata as the metadata attributes are defined as part of the keychain API and not as part of the object API. If objects are not stored in a keychain, they simply cannot have metadata. See Update 2 of my question.
The public key hash, which is required to match private keys to their certificates, is stored within the metadata. So a SecKeyRef not backed up by keychain storage cannot have such a hash. Generating an identity (SecIdentityRef) with a key not stored in a keychain is thus simply not possible. The certificate doesn't have to be stored in a keychain but the key has.
So far I was just adding my key using SecItemAdd(), which seems to do exactly what the name implies, it just adds the item to keychain, and it only does what the name implies, so it won't do anything but adding the item to keychain as is. If the item already has a public key hash, it will also have a public key hash when being added to a (new/different) keychain, but only items already within keychains can have this attribute. The result was an item not having a correct public key hash set and this is the cause of all my problems.
Now my code uses the SecItemImport() function, which is a lot more powerful, as an ""import"" may require a lot more steps than just adding something keychain. Apparently this import function will also make sure that the public key hash in the meta data is correctly populated when importing the item. To make this import possible, my new code first needs to export the existing key and so it can then re-import the key directly into the desired keychain.
Update
Maybe interesting to know, there exists a function with the following syntax:
SecIdentityRef SecIdentityCreate(
    CFAllocatorRef allocator, 
    SecCertificateRef certificate, 
    SecKeyRef privateKey
);

that works exactly the way I was desiring it. ffmpeg is actually using it. But this is private API, you must not use it if you plan to submit your software to any app store (using private API will have your software rejected).

"26714704","RSA_Private_Decrypt fails randomly","I am not a crypto expert, but I wrote encrypt/decrypt methods. I don't know what I am doing wrong here. The encryptKey method returns the variable text length every time for the same string, which is may be due to RSA_PKCS1_PADDING which I am using, but for same string of text, the decryptKey function fails if the encrypted text length is below some threshold.
//----------------------Encryption -----------------------
int Asymmetric::encryptKey(unsigned char *data, int data_len, unsigned char *encrypted)
{
    RSA * rsa = createRSA(1); // Loads the public key
    int result = RSA_public_encrypt(data_len,data,encrypted,rsa,padding);
    return result;
}
//-----------------------Decryption -----------------------
int Asymmetric::decryptKey(unsigned char * enc_data,int data_len, unsigned char *decrypted)
{
    RSA * rsa = createRSA(0); // Loads the private key
    int  result = RSA_private_decrypt(data_len,enc_data,decrypted,rsa,padding);
    return result;
}

How i can overcome this situation?
Edit: 
This code does not work 
char *myData = ""Sample Text"";
unsigned char *encrypt = (unsigned char*)malloc(RSA_size(rsaPub));
int result = RSA_public_encrypt(RSA_size(rsaPub)-11 ,(unsigned char*)myData,encrypt,rsaPub,padding);
fprintf(stderr, ""\nEnc Size: %d \n"", strlen((const char*)encrypt));

","If you perform padding, cipher text should have fixed size equal to RSA public key modulus. If you get different size every time, then there is something with your program.
When you perform encryption data must be less than RSA_size(rsa) - 11 and encrypted must point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.
strlen(const char * str) computes length of null-terminated string. encrypt is not the string and is not null terminated, so using strlen is not valid here. Luckily for you PKCS#1 padding contains zero bytes, so you don't get segmentation fault.
On the other hand myData is a null terminated string. However, you use RSA_size(rsaPub) - 11 as its length, which will result in occasional segmentation faults.

","That error means that somewhere after the certificate learned where the key was being stored it got deleted.

Maybe something is calling CngKey.Delete
Maybe something is cloning it into an RSACryptoServiceProvider and setting PersistKeyInCsp to false.
Maybe something is just cleaning up the machine keys directory after the fact.
The other (very rare) known case is where two threads load the PFX in parallel (they don't have to be in the same process) with one of them not having PersistKeySet asserted at import time.

If you're loading and discarding the certificates you really shouldn't set PersistKeySet.  Every time you open a PFX another file is created on disk for each private key contained therein... those files get cleaned up normally (as long as the process doesn't abnormally terminate), but PersistKeySet prevents that cleanup from happening.
If nothing in code analysis reveals the two obvious key deletion locations (PersistKeyInCsp=false being the sneaky one) then you'll have to follow the filesystem auditing recommendations in .NET Core X509Certificate2.PrivateKey throws nte_bad_keyset error.

","Maybe you didn't give IIS access to your private keys. I had same error, but it was necessary to use X509 Certs instead of keys. I've just granted a permission to read private keys from cert for IIS_IUSRS on MMC. It helps for me. 
There's a full answer from @thames: 
How to give ASP.NET access to a private key in a certificate in the certificate store?
UPD: 
Step-by-step guide:

Create/purchase cert with private key
Import cert to ""Local Computer"" account (not ""Current User""). Check ""Allow private key to be exported"" in Import Wizard.
Open MMC Console and add Certificates Snap-In. Choose ""Computer Account"". 
Find your cert and right-click on it. Choose ""All Tasks"" > ""Manage Private Keys""
Add Read access to your key for user IIS_IUSRS or IIS AppPool\<AppPoolName> (depends on IIS version and config. It's better to use ""Advanced"" button to show all possible options)
Restart your application

check and can tell me that the given file is a valid certificate file or private key file

I'm going to answer this in C because OpenSSL is a C library. Others may be able to translate it into pyOpenSSL, in which case they probably have a better answer than mine.
There are two answers here. One is for the certificate, and the second is for the private key. The private key is shown first because it is used to validate the certificate (so it makes sense to visit it first).
Also, its important to call the *_check_key routines because OpenSSL only checks that a key is well encoded; and it does not check that its actually valid. See, for example, Private key generated by openssl does not satisfy n = p * q.

In OpenSSL, you would use the following to verify the the private key:
FILE* file = fopen(...);
EVP_PKEY* pkey = PEM_read_PrivateKey(file, NULL, PasswordCallback, NULL);
unsigned long err = ERR_get_error();

if(pkey)
    EVP_PKEY_free(pkey);

If pkey is NULL, then there was a problem and err holds a reason code. Otherwise, you have a properly encoded private key (but not necessarily valid).
PasswordCallback can simply provide a password in the buffer, or it can prompt the user and return the password in the buffer. For more on PasswordCallback, see Loading a PEM format certificate.
If the key is properly encoded, you can check the type of private key and validate it with the following.
int type = EVP_PKEY_get_type(pkey);
switch (type)
{
case EVP_PKEY_RSA:
case EVP_PKEY_RSA2:
    RSA* rsa = EVP_PKEY_get1_RSA(pkey);
    rc = RSA_check_key(rsa);
    ASSERT(rc);
    RSA_free(rsa);

    break;

case EVP_PKEY_DSA:
case EVP_PKEY_DSA1:
case EVP_PKEY_DSA2:
case EVP_PKEY_DSA3:
case EVP_PKEY_DSA4:
    DSA* dsa = EVP_PKEY_get1_DSA(pkey);
    rc = DSA_check_key(dsa);
    ASSERT(rc);
    DSA_free(dsa);

    break;

case EVP_PKEY_DH:
    DH* dh = EVP_PKEY_get1_DH(pkey);
    rc = DH_check_key(dh);
    ASSERT(rc);
    DH_free(dh);

    break;

case EVP_PKEY_EC:
    EC_KEY* ec = EVP_PKEY_get1_EC_KEY(pkey);
    rc = EC_KEY_check_key(ec);
    ASSERT(rc);
    EC_KEY_free(ec);

    break;

default:
    ASSERT(0);
}

EVP_PKEY_get_type is not part of OpenSSL. Here's how I implemented it:
int EVP_PKEY_get_type(EVP_PKEY *pkey)
{
    ASSERT(pkey);
    if (!pkey)
        return NID_undef;

    return EVP_PKEY_type(pkey->type);
}


In OpenSSL, you would use the following to verify the the certificate:
FILE* file = fopen(...);
X509* x509 = PEM_read_X509(file, NULL, NULL, NULL);
unsigned long err = ERR_get_error();

If x509 is NULL, then there was a problem and err holds a reason code. Otherwise, you have a properly encoded certificate (but not necessarily valid).
You can then verify the certificate with:
/* See above on validating the private key */
EVP_PKEY* pkey = ReadPrivateKey(...);

int rc = X509_verify(x509, pkey);
err = ERR_get_error();

If rc != 1, then there was a problem and err holds a reason code. Otherwise, you have a valid certificate and private key pair. If the certificate is valid, then you can't use err because err is only valid if there's a problem.
If your certificate is signed by an issuer (for example, a CA or intermediate), then you need to use a X509_STORE to verify the issuer's signature on your certificate (a lot of error checking omitted):
const char* serverCertFilename = ...;
const char* issuerCertFilename = ...;    

X509_STORE* store = X509_STORE_new();
ASSERT(store);

static const long flags = X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT | X509_V_FLAG_CHECK_SS_SIGNATURE
        | X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK;
rc = X509_STORE_set_flags(store, flags);
err = ERR_get_error();
ASSERT(rc);

/* Some other object/functions owns 'lookup', but I'm not sure which (perhaps the store) */
X509_LOOKUP* lookup = X509_STORE_add_lookup(store, X509_LOOKUP_file());
/* err = ERR_get_error(); // Does not set error codes. */
ASSERT(lookup);    

/* Cannot load this from memory. No API!!! */
rc = X509_LOOKUP_load_file(lookup, issuerCertFilename, X509_FILETYPE_PEM);
/* err = ERR_get_error(); // Does not set error codes. */
ASSERT(rc);

X509_STORE_CTX* ctx = X509_STORE_CTX_new();
ASSERT(ctx);

X509* serverCert = ReadCertifcate(serverCertFilename);
ASSERT(serverCert);

rc = X509_STORE_CTX_init(ctx, store, serverCert, NULL);
ret = err = ERR_get_error();
ASSERT(rc);

/* Error codes at https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/X509_STORE_CTX_get_error.html */
rc = X509_verify_cert(ctx);
err = X509_STORE_CTX_get_error(ctx);

I would appreciate most if you could suggest me on the above to know how to include the private key with this certificate to call the web service from my code.
Thanks in advance.
","The problem is because you imported your certificate to Windows Certificate store, but haven't associated with a private key. You have to merge .cer and .pkcs8 files into PFX container. You can use certutil.exe too for that:
certutil -mergepfx path\mycert.cer path\mycert.pfx

Note: rename your key file to have matching to certificate file name and change extension to .key. That is, both files must be in the same folder and have names, like this: mycert.cer, mycert.key.

","You're confusing several things here.

You don't necessarily have a private key at all in a client;
an SSL server practically always has a private key; but
SSL is not encrypted with public/private keys, it is encrypted with a symmetric session key which is generated for the session using the algorithm defined in RFC 2246.

","As pointed out by EJP, this is only relevant if you're running a server, not a client.
If running a server, the location and format of the key used is detailed in the specific server's configuration. Some servers also include a procedure for exporting this key, which is inside a container or keystore.
Note also that even if you do obtain the private key, certain SSL cipher suites- notably those using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism - will prevent Wireshark from decrypting the traffic.

How is this implemented?  Are the private keys imported through such means really become completely non-extractable, or is there still a way to get a hold of them through some kind of memory dump?  How do applications still use such keys for their crypto?
","I'm not sure how the applications still use such keys, but as per https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/6043/extract-non-extractable-private-key-from-os-x-keychain, it appears that this is simply implemented as a bit attribute for CSSM_KEYATTR_FLAGS keyAttributes of struct SecKeyImportExportParameters named CSSM_KEYATTR_EXTRACTABLE.

http://opensource.apple.com/source/SecurityTool/SecurityTool-55115/keychain_import.c
http://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-55471.14/libsecurity_keychain/lib/SecImportExport.h

As per the above, when the import is done, this attribute is specifically omitted when the -x option is specified to security import.

According to SecItem.h, this kSecAttrIsExtractable has been introduced with OS X 10.6.

http://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-55471.14/libsecurity_keychain/lib/SecItem.h


Subsequently, when trying to do a wrapped export, several places within the Security framework appear to check to make sure that this CSSM_KEYATTR_EXTRACTABLE bit is set prior to doing any kind of export, and return an error in case the attribute is not set.

Thanks
","Use latest BouncyCastle and setup security in your code in the following way:
    Security.removeProvider(BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME);
    Security.insertProviderAt(new BouncyCastleProvider(), 1);

It sets Bouncy Castle library as preferred security provider; Android's default provider config has BC at position 3 so this code will remove it and insert BC again at position 1.
It solved the problem for me.

client can run an utility sent by me via some cd or DVD (May be an openSSL script) needs to accept some parameters so that end user can supply keyword/password data.
The script will generate private key and CSR back to my company via some secure way (may be through email, I know it is not safe but some how they send us back CSR)
We receive the CSR and we sign it and return to the client.

So I need to document this, so that the end user can understand what he is doing.
So my question is where can I get the script to send to client so that he can generate his own CSR and PrivateKey.

"23467199","How to send public key only to verify digital signature","This is not a 100% c# or ASP.NET question, it's rather a mixture of security and programming. So I apologize ahead.  I need to integrate file signing module to my ASP.NET web application. I also need to write a utility application that will verify the signature. I know how to both sign a file and verify it. Here's how I do signing:
       private byte[] SignFile(byte[] fileData){
        X509Certificate2 cert=GetCertificate();
        RSACryptoServiceProvider csp = cert.PrivateKey;

        SHA1Managed sha1 = new SHA1Managed();
        byte[] hash = sha1.ComputeHash(fileData);
        return csp.SignData(hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""));
      }

So far so good. On the other hand, when verifying I will need the public key. So here's my question. Do I need to send the certificate with the signed file so that the other side can take the public key to verify the signature. If so, this brings another question to mind: Can't someone else take the private key from attached certificate to edit the file and sign it again? What is the proper way of doing this? 
","To verify a signature that you create using a pub/private key pair, the other party needs your public key only. You should always protect your private key and never let it get out, or a malicious party can pretend to be you.
With X509Certificate2 you can use the GetPublicKeyString method to get the hex string and pass it to them in a text format. You may also simply use the Export and Import methods to exchange only the public key.
PGP works on exactly the same principle, but assumes that the public key is exchanged through a separate trusted channel (such as a physical meeting and exchange of USB stick) so that the recipient knows that the public key is real and not a fake. If you are using certificates from a CA then the CA signing chain will imply the public key trust for you to as good a degree as is practically possible.
Code sample for Export and Import:
var cspSig = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)cert.PrivateKey;
var sig = cspSig.SignHash(hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""));
var pubKeyBytes = cert.Export(X509ContentType.Cert);
// either send the client the bytes, or the cert file ...
File.WriteAllBytes(""MyCert.cer"", pubKeyBytes);

and on the client ...
var pubCert = new X509Certificate2();
pubCert.Import(pubKeyBytes);
var cspVer = (RSACryptoServiceProvider)pubCert.PublicKey.Key;
var isValid = cspVer.VerifyHash(hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID(""SHA1""), sig);
var hasPrivateKey = pubCert.HasPrivateKey; // will equal false if using .Export(X509ContentType.Cert)

Apparently, there is an Apple known bug about this thing, with no known workaround (this is taken from Apple's DTS response).
The private key CAN be deleted if there's an ACL restricting access to it and allowing one and ONLY one application to access the key.
So, Theoretically, it is possible to change the access object and restrict the ACL lists and then deleting it. 
But.... Unfortunately, Trying to manipulate the identity's access object to have the same ACLs as when you change it manually by Keychain Access doesn't behave as nicely...
If you do manage to restrict by any chance then the rest is easy enough:   
So here is a code snippet just in case anyone finds it useful:
OSStatus status       = errSecSuccess;
CFTypeRef identityRef = NULL;
CFStringRef certLabel = NULL;

const char *certLabelString = ""Some string identifying your certificate"";
certLabel = CFStringCreateWithCString(NULL, certLabelString, kCFStringEncodingUTF8);

const void *keys[]    = { kSecClass,    kSecAttrLabel,   kSecReturnRef };
const void *values[]  = { kSecClassIdentity, certLabel, kCFBooleanTrue };
CFDictionaryRef query = CFDictionaryCreate(NULL, keys, values, 3, NULL, NULL);

// First we extract the identity out of the keychain
status = SecItemCopyMatching(query, &identityRef);
if (status != errSecSuccess)
{ 
    s_log(SecCopyErrorMessageString(status, NULL));
    CFRelease(certLabel);
    CFRelease(query);
    if (identityRef)
        CFRelease(identityRef);

    return -1;
}

CFRelease(certLabel);
CFRelease(query);

// We have obtained the identity so we can delete it
CFArrayRef itemList = CFArrayCreate(NULL, &identityRef, 1, NULL);
const void *keys2[]   = { kSecClass,  kSecMatchItemList,  kSecMatchLimit };
const void *values2[] = { kSecClassIdentity, itemList, kSecMatchLimitAll };

CFDictionaryRef dict = CFDictionaryCreate(NULL, keys2, values2, 3, NULL, NULL);
status = SecItemDelete(dict);

if (status != errSecSuccess) {
    s_log(SecCopyErrorMessageString(status, NULL));
    CFRelease(dict);
    CFRelease(itemList);
    CFRelease(identityRef);
    return -2;
}

But I need to feed the library with the keys on Base64 or NSData, I can't feed SecKeyRef. I managed to extract the NSData for the publicKey using the methods provided here, it works.
But I can't find any way to convert a SecRefKey that points to a privateKey to NSData. Any ideas on how to do this, OR, sign and verify data in iOS using ECC with SecKeyRefs.

","Looks like you simply need to use SecKeyCopyExternalRepresentation:

    @result A CFData representing the key in a format suitable for that key type.
    @discussion This function may fail if the key is not exportable (e.g., bound to a smart card or Secure Enclave).
    The format in which the key will be exported depends on the type of key:

    * kSecAttrKeyTypeECSECPrimeRandom    SEC1 format (www.secg.org)

I have a project on my github, which is in private mode and I have to developers that I would like 
to work with. So, far the only way to work on this private repo is to hand them the email/password to my 
github account, which we all know is not going to happen. 
So, since I haven't worked on team projects, I don't know the exact steps I have to do to grant them access, 
and which exact steps they should then take to access it. 
So, I think the first thing to do: Checking for existing SSH keys via gitbash

So, after generating the keys and copying the keys to clipboard via clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now, my question is, assuming what I have done is so far correct, how do I allow these three collaborators access to my repo?

If a certificate imported to cert store that the private key not in local computer (on USB token, external storage, e.g. mobile device), it can found?
","When you import a certificate to the system store, Windows creates a BLOB structure that contains an encoded certificate itself and it properties. 
BLOB has following structure:
property1_id (4 bytes)
reserved = 0x00000001
property1_length (4 bytes)
property1_data[property1_length]
...
cert_property_id = 0x00000020
reserved = 0x00000001
cert_data_length (4 bytes)
cert_data[cert_data_length]

Therefore, if you want that your imported certificate to have link to a private key, you need to set CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID. You can achieve that with CRYPT_KEY_PROV_INFO structure and CertSetCertificateContextProperty function.
For example:
#include <Windows.h>
#include <wincrypt.h>

void SetKeyLink()

    der_encoded_cert = LoadFromFile();

    pCertContext = CertCreateCertificateContext(X509_ASN_ENCODING, der_encoded_cert.data(), der_encoded_cert.size());
    if (!pCertContext)

    key_prov_info.cProvParam = 0;
    key_prov_info.pwszProvName = nullptr;
    key_prov_info.rgProvParam = 0;

    /*

    key_prov_info.dwFlags = CERT_SET_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID;

    key_prov_info.dwKeySpec = 0;
    key_prov_info.cProvParam = 0;
    key_prov_info.rgProvParam = 0;

    if (!CertSetCertificateContextProperty(pCertContext, CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID, 0, &key_prov_info))

For now your certificate will look something like this (sorry for not English):

When Windows wants to get private key, it calls CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey which in turn calls CertGetCertificateContextProperty(..., CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID, ...).

","GetCngPrivateKey was part of the 4.6 preview, but was removed for 4.6 release.  It was replaced with GetRSAPrivateKey (and GetECDsaPrivateKey (4.6.1) and GetDSAPrivateKey (4.6.2)).
The Get[Algorithm]{Public|Private}Key methods will return CNG usually (on Windows) and CAPI (CryptoServiceProvider) when they need to.  On non-Windows systems (for .NET Core) they use whatever the appropriate backing type is for the system.
The new methods also have the advantage that you almost never need to cast the return type. On 4.6 the RSA base class was enhanced so that all RSA operations could be done without casting. On 4.6.1 ECDSA was enhanced, and on 4.6 DSA was enhanced. The only reason to cast is for interop (like trying to get the name of the persisted key).

","Java's SecureRandom implementation depends on the available providers, so it can be different on different OS's or for different implementations.
On linux, the default implementation is NativePRNG, which ignores your seed AFAIK.
What you could do is serialize your secure random before you call the generation, and deserialize it to reset it for the next generation.

I am assuming RSA for the keys generation, encryption and decryption but if it's easier to do with another scheme feel free to comment.
","Hmm, interesting.
You're referring to RSA, I assume?
FYI, RSA isn't actually used to encrypt documents. It's used to exchange keys (keys for a symmetric algorithm, like AES).
So what you're really talking about is an approach that changes the keys.
Technically (mathmatically) if you put a different number in, you'll get a different number out. So that's not an issue; changing the public key in some fashion will (assuming you convince your RSA implementation to use it, or prepare an appropriately different number) result in a different symmetric key, thus an undecryptable document by Bob (because he'll expect a different key).
Really, though, I'm not so sure you care about this. It's a fairly useless thing to do. Perhaps, however, you're actually interested in Key Splitting (or ""Secret Sharing"" as wikipedia seems to call it).
HTH. I'm by no means an expert.

","As silky implies in his answer, the way in which RSA is usually used to encrypt a document is in combination with a symmetric algorithm, like AES.  A secure random key is generated for the AES algorithm, the documented is encrypted with that AES key, and the AES key is encrypted with the recipient's public key.  Both parts are supplied to the recipient.
You can adapt this to your situation simply by sending only the document encrypted with the AES key in the first step, and withholding the AES key encrypted with the recipient's public key until the second step.  The first part will be on the order of the original file size, and the second part will be a small, constant size (on the order of the RSA key size).

","(I assume you talk about RSA.)
Yes it is possible, but not 100%.
The public key is a part of the private key. It contains the modulus and the exponent of the key. 
You can completely forget changing the modulus, because you would have to generate a new rsa keypair, which is the same problem as the one we are trying to solve.
But it is possible to change the exponent. You can select any (prime) number between 1 and your exponent as the new exponent and hope that it is coprime with the totient. Without knowing the totient it's impossible to select always a correct exponent. To find out the totient you would have to know the prime factors of the key, which means that you would have to break the key (have fun!).
So, it's actually impossible to have a 100% percent working method to do that, at least not while knowing only the public key.
If you need more information about the theory check here

","I hope my idea works. 
Let us assume that (e,d,n) is a tuple of the RSA public exponent. The RSA private exponent and the RSA modulus n :
Select a prime number, say p,  between 1 and a 256 bit integer.
To encrypt a message m, compute the new public exponent as e*p and the ciphertext as: 
c= m^{e*p} mod n. 
To decrypt, the receiver should know the prime p, so you send this p later to him, with this he computes 
(1) P = p^{-1} mod phi(n)
and
(2) m^e=c^{P} mod n 
and 
finally m=(m^e)^d mod n. This works as the receiver knows phi(n). 
By the way, where can we use this? Is there any application you have in mind for this?

You can also encrypt sections of the web.config section starting with asp.net 2.0

If you can keep it on the machine.config, that will ensure that it only lives on that machine and no where else.

","There isn't a security benefit.  There is a convenience benefit, in that you don't have to recompile your classes that use these values in the event that they change.
From a security perspective, the classes have the same level of security.  The web.config and any class files (in App_Code) or compiled assemblies (in the bin folder) will not be able to be downloaded (those directories are not mapped to virtual directories which people can download from).
If they are obtained, however, there's really no security on either of them.  web.config files are easily readable, and with tools like Reflector, it's easy to see the constants you have in a compiled assembly.
The only benefit that web.config has over a compiled assembly is that you can encrypt sections of the web.config file, as Scott Guthrie points out in his blog.

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

Replacing OPENSSH with RSA in the generated private key has no effect on the success of the exercise.
If I try the same sequence of operations on a debian docker image, the key generated by ssh can successfully read by openssl running on the same platform.
Is my expectation that this would also work on OSX unreasonable? If so, what's gone wrong?
edit: I had a spurious -o option in the example which I have now removed.
","The problem was that the default behaviour of ssh-keygen on OSX Mojave now differs from that on Linux. In particular, ssh-keygen will produce OPENSSH private keys by default on OSX but RSA private keys by default on Linux.
The same behaviour can be guaranteed in both environments by adding -m PEM to the ssh-keygen arguments.

"32660127","How to convert JKS into Docker Registry cert/key?","I am trying to set up a secure Docker Registry on two VMs (for HA) and have a question about setting up the SSL. According to that link in the docs, I need to have a certs directory with two files in it:

registry.crt - the CA cert
registry.key - ??? (private key?)

I have been given a Java JKS (keystore) that contains in it a wildcard CA cert that will work for these VMs. I was able to successfully export the cert out of the keystore like so:
keytool -export -alias certalias -file registry.crt -keystore mycerts.jks

So far so good: I have registry.crt. However a few related questions/concerns are preventing me from completing this setup:

What is the *.key file, how is it different than the cert, and how do I extract it from the JKS?
Where is Docker/Registry expecting this certs directory on each VM? Perhaps /home/myuser/? Is this location configurable?!?
As the link explains, a special additional action is required if your CA cert is an ""intermediary"" cert. How can I tell if my cert is intermediary or not?

","There are really three questions here. You should probably ask different questions. I don't know the answer to your second one but will answer for the other two.

In simple terms in the context of SSL the client initiates a secure connection using the public key contained in the certificate. Only the server who possesses the according (private) key can answer and therefore establish the connection. (There's a lot more going on.)
The short regarding the keystore is: Do yourself a favor and use a tool like KeyStore Explorer. No affiliation, I just like the tool. Exporting the private key with keytool is not that simple. As far as I know you cannot export the private key directly. You can however export to PKCS12 and use other tools like OpenSSL from there:

keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore existing-store.jks -destkeystore new-store.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12

If you only have one self-signed certificate (signer is the same as subject), you don't need to worry about intermediaries. An intermediate certificate means that the certificate signed by the CA that signed your certificate is itself signed by yet another CA.
CA 0 (signed by CA 0) - well known certificate, self-signed
 \_ CA 1 (signed by CA 0) - intermediate certificate
     \_ Your Cert (signed by CA 1)

In order to verify the integrity of your certificate the whole chain must be known to the client. Usually only the CAs at the very top are distributed in browsers and operating systems (CA 0) so you need to publish the certificates ""in between""—the intermediaries (CA 1).

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
which leads me to believe it is in the PKCS#1 format. Instead of using the PEM file, I want to generate a binary file and read the private key into the Java program. As per here, I used the following openssl code to generate a DER file:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in private.pem -outform der -out private.der

Then used this Java code to try to read in the DER file:
Path path = Paths.get(privateKeyLocation);

","I'm having the same problem for decryption, using both MSCAPI and PKCS#11. I found that the P11RSAChiper implemented in SunPKCS11 doesn't regard the wrap/unwrap methods, and it uses encrypt/decrypt for this purpose, which in my case conflicts with underlying layer of security, where the private key is marked just for unwrap by the SmartCard profile.

First things first, let me explain you the customer need.
For my customer's website, at some point a user needs to generate a private key and public key client side (gui : browser) then send the public key to the server and save the private key (crypted by a user choosen password) locally. The private key needs to be saved because it is used once in a second part of the process (the user needs to enter his password in order to decrypt it), once used we can dispose of the private key.

Second solution : Saving crypted private key in a cookie
We kept the java applet, but it does not save anything on disk, it is only used to perform cryptographic actions. We passed from the applet a crypted private key to the javascript to save in a cookie.

","Cookies are sent in each request. This is really really bad because you want the private key to not sent over the network as much as possible.
Assuming you can't have local storage (IE7), the only way I know to store info on the cient side is cookies. I'd say : use local storage as much as possible, and when you can't, store the private key on the server side. At least, you'll be sending it once. it's bad, but less than really really bad ...
Or maybe you could store cookies on a dedicated subdomain that you never use again, but in order to read the cookie, even on the client side with javascript, you need to be on a page of that subdomain, and that means sending the key over the network again everytime you want to use it.

","The main problem is  that cookies are only meant for things you are sending to the server. They are not meant for storage and you should not be sending your private key anywhere, ever.
Cookies can be stolen via XSS (always assume you have an XSS vuln in your site) and the attacker can then try to decrypt it.
On the grand scale of things you could do a lot worse. Assuming your crypto is solid, the private key is probably safe, but the big issue is that you shouldn't be using cookies like this. Using Web Storage is probably a far better solution here.

","I´d say that saving your private key in a cookies isn´t a really good choice since they are not supposed to hold sensitive information due security reasons, and our colleagues already told other reasons.
It´s also important to notice that the user may clear all his cookies at any given time or disable it at all.
The applet would meet better your customer requirements and would let you for example prompt the user to save a keystore file with the private key, this kind file was designed to hold this kind of information.

Since the key is received dynamically and the app is prohibited from using JNI, I'm not able to use openssl to convert the key.
Instead, I'm looking for a pure Java solution for converting from SSLeay to PKCS#8 or other format from which a PrivateKey can be constructed.
Googling shows a couple of third party libraries that handle SSLeay keys (eg, one from ""Entrust"") but am unfortunately constrained in this implementation to use no external libraries. Yes, I know. Not even Commons.
Does anybody know of any tools within the JSE 7 standard library that would help with this? I don't mind wading into writing the conversion myself, but have had a hard time locating a precise spec for SSLeay.
Thank you for any pointers!
","Note that this answer is only useful if one is constrained, as I was, to avoid the use of any 3rd party libraries. If you're allowed to use BouncyCastle or other libraries, that's presumably a better way to go.
The key I was receiving was an RSA key in OpenSSL (""traditional SSLeay"") DER format encoded to PEM. I was able to get a Java java.security.PrivateKey object in the following way:

Wrote a simplistic DER parser that only handles DER tag type 2 (integers). The parser had to handle reading the DER sequence tag (0x30) and fixed and variable length objects.
Used String.replace to get rid of the RSA key header and footer in the PEM string.
Used DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary() to get a byte array from the PEM string.
Used the DER parser to extract BigIntegers from the data: version, modulus, public exponent, private exponent, prime P, prime Q, prime exponent P, prime exponent Q, and CRT coefficient (in that order).
Created a java.security.spec.RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec object (keySpec) from those values.
PrivateKey key = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"").generatePrivate(keySpec);

This worked for my purposes, but is an unfortunate reinvention of a couple of wheels.

The method used for loading the private key from file is below:

    SecKeyRef privateKeyRef = NULL;

    CFArrayRef items = CFArrayCreate(NULL, 0, 0, NULL);

    OSStatus securityError = SecPKCS12Import((CFDataRef)data,
                                             (CFDictionaryRef)options, &items);

    if (securityError == noErr && CFArrayGetCount(items) > 0) {
        CFDictionaryRef identityDict = CFArrayGetValueAtIndex(items, 0);
        SecIdentityRef identityApp =
        (SecIdentityRef)CFDictionaryGetValue(identityDict,
                                             kSecImportItemIdentity);

        }
    }
    [options release];
    if (items) CFRelease(items);
    return privateKeyRef;
}

And this is the test case I use. Notice that two different strings are printed on iOS and MacOSX:
    NSString *test = @""bla"";
    NSData *testData = [test dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

    NSString *p12Path= [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""private_key"" ofType:@""p12""];

    NSData *p12Data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:p12Path];

    SecKeyRef keyRef = [BMSecurityHelper newPrivateKeyRefWithPassword:@""xxxxxxxx"" fromData:p12Data];

    NSData *signatureData = [testData signatureWithKey:keyRef];
    NSString *signatureString = [BMEncodingHelper base64EncodedStringForData:signatureData withLineLength:0];

    if (keyRef) CFRelease(keyRef);

    NSLog(@""signatureString: %@"", signatureString);

","It's always nice if you can answer your own question. I missed the following: under MacOSX the security transform also calculates the SHA-1 hash automatically, in contrast with the iOS implementation.
I fixed the problem by adding the following in the MacOSX implementation:
SecTransformSetAttribute(signer, kSecInputIsAttributeName, kSecInputIsDigest, &error)

My server requires client authentication & so I've to set client's private key stored in a password protected PEM file. I use the following code for this purpose:
/* set the private key from KeyFile */
if (SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(ctx, KeyFile, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM) <= 0)
{
    ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
    abort();
}

/* verify private key */
if ( !SSL_CTX_check_private_key(ctx) )
{
    fprintf(stderr, ""Private key does not match the public certificate\n"");
    abort();
}

Now I want to know how can I establish a SSL connection using private key stored on a security token (with PKCS#11 interface) instead of reading it from a file?
","Answer is a little bit complicated. 
First You need to load Engine of your PKCS#11:
ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
{
    if (!(e = ENGINE_by_id(""dynamic"")))
        goto err;
    if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""SO_PATH"", ""dstu"", 0))
        goto err;
    if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""LIST_ADD"", ""2"", 0))
        goto err;
    if (!ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, ""LOAD"", NULL, 0))
        goto err;
    e = ENGINE_by_id(""pkcs11_engine"");
    if (!e)
      return error;

res = ENGINE_init(e);
if (!ENGINE_set_default(e, ENGINE_METHOD_ALL))
    goto err;

}
then you need load EVP_PKEY* from engine
EVP_PKEY* key = ENGINE_load_private_key(e, ""SecureToken"", NULL, &cb_data);
and pass it to SSL:
int SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey(SSL_CTX *ctx, EVP_PKEY *pkey);
strings SecureToken and pkcs11_engine you should found in documentation to your engine pkcs11 module

It works awesome with a public key. But my question is how can I parse a X.509 private key? I'm not really familiar with structure of the RSA key.
The keys are generated from node-rsa in node.js
Thanks in advance. <3
","You currently have a functioning reader for the RSAPublicKey structure. That structure, and the RSAPrivateKey structure, can be found in (RFC 3447 Appendix A.1)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#appendix-A].
.NET does not support ""multi-prime"" (more than 2) RSA (but neither does anyone else), so you can stick with the version 0 format. The field names should be clear from the alternative names in the comments, but if it is unclear:

modulus -> Modulus
publicExponent -> Exponent
privateExponent -> D
prime1 -> P
prime2 -> Q
exponent1 -> DP
exponent2 -> DQ
coefficient -> InverseQ

You will also need to add (or remove) padding zeros (on the left) to the values such that

D.Length == Modulus.Length
hm = (Modulus.Length + 1) / 2 // half round up
P, Q, DP, DQ, InverseQ each have Length == hm.

","I had the same problem and tried a couple of days to figure out how it works and finally, I got it!
Your private key not in PKCS#8 format. 
A PKCS8 key starts with 
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
instead of 
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----.
Java works with PKCS#8 formats.
So you have two ways to fix it:
First:
Regenerate/convert your key on the server side in/to PCKS#8 format and use it in android application
Or Second:
Convert your private key in the application.
For this way you need include third party library
to the project.
Add this line into your app Gradle
compile 'com.madgag.spongycastle:core:1.56.0.0'
And replace your getPrivateKey method with this:
`public static PrivateKey getPrivateKey(Context context) throws 
GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
        InputStream is = context.getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.rsa_2048_priv);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
        List<String> lines = new ArrayList<String>();
        String line = null;

            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null)
                lines.add(line);

            if (lines.size() > 1 && lines.get(0).startsWith(""-----"") && lines.get(lines.size() - 1).startsWith(""-----"")) {
                lines.remove(0);
                lines.remove(lines.size() - 1);
            }

            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (String aLine : lines)
                sb.append(aLine);
            String keyString = sb.toString();

            byte[] encodedPrivateKey = Base64.decode(keyString, Base64.DEFAULT);

            try {
                ASN1Sequence primitive = (ASN1Sequence) ASN1Sequence
                        .fromByteArray(encodedPrivateKey);
                Enumeration<?> e = primitive.getObjects();
                BigInteger v = ((ASN1Integer) e.nextElement()).getValue();

                int version = v.intValue();
                if (version != 0 && version != 1) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(""wrong version for RSA private key"");
                }
                /**
                 * In fact only modulus and private exponent are in use.
                 */
                BigInteger modulus = ((ASN1Integer) e.nextElement()).getValue();
                BigInteger publicExponent = ((ASN1Integer) e.nextElement()).getValue();
                BigInteger privateExponent = ((ASN1Integer) e.nextElement()).getValue();

                RSAPrivateKeySpec spec = new RSAPrivateKeySpec(modulus, privateExponent);
                KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
                return kf.generatePrivate(spec);
            } catch (IOException e2) {
                throw new IllegalStateException();
            } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(e);
            } catch (InvalidKeySpecException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(e);
            }

    }`

So it will convert private key to the PKCS#8,
and you can decode your text without error of wrong tag
Hope it help :)

I can not understand the example, given here http://securityinnovation.com/cryptolab/pdf/NTRUTech004v2.pdf
I'll be very thankful if anyone could show an example in detail.  
","(Full disclosure: I work for Security Innovation and worked for NTRU until SI acquired us)
Warning: Long answer!
Let's look at a toy example: N = 11, q = 29. Let's take df = 3, so f consists of 3 coefficients equal to 1 and 8 coefficients equal to 0. Take dg = 5. And assume that h = g*f^{-1} mod p, rather than using the optimizations that have f = 1+pF. Then we might have
f = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
finv = [16, 12, 4, 18, 17, 14, 9, 28, 8, 26, 3]
g = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
h = [15, 20, 1, 21, 4, 26, 14, 17, 25, 11, 12]

You can check that f*h = g here.
The attacker wants to find f, so they can do the brute force search for df = 3. They can speed this up by taking advantage of the fact that there will be some rotation of f that has a 1 in the first position, so they only need to search the (10 pick 2) possible locations for the other two nonzero coefficients of f. The full search they perform is this:
           f*h (=g)                                       f
[9, 18, 7, 13, 26, 22, 15, 28, 27, 24, 19]; [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Scan down there, and you can see that g appears in row 14, 26 and 34 of the 45 rows. (g appears three times because there are three 1's in f, so there are three rotations of f that have a 1 in the leading position).
Now let's look at the meet-in-the-middle attack. The attacker uses the formula
(f1+f2) * h = g

so
f1*h = g - f2*h

Using e[i] to mean the i'th coefficient of e, this means that the attacker knows that
(f1*h)[i] = - (f2*h)[i] + 0 or 1

So the attacker calculates all possible values of f1*h. Call the resulting list {g1}. They then calculate -f2*h and for each result g2, they see if g2 is the same as an existing g1 or if g2 differs from any g1 by no more than 1 in each coefficient. In other words,
[3, 10, 12, 7]

would match
[4, 10, 12, 8]

Doing it this way, the attacker needs only work through the following:

All 10 f1s with a 1 in the leading position and a 1 somewhere else
All 10 f2s with a single 1 in any position other than the leading one

This gives the following. I've sorted the lists to make the matches easier to spot.
          f1*h = g1                                           f1

line 6 of g1 matches with line 5 of g2, giving [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
line 7 of g1 matches with line 6 of g2, giving [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
line 8 of g1 matches with line 8 of g2, giving [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
line 9 of g1 matches with line 9 of g2, giving [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

There are 6 collisions here because there are 3 rotations with a 1 in the leading position and for each rotation there are two ways to pick the other two coefficients.
So an attacker would have to do about 45/3 = 15 work to find the key with a brute force search and about 10 work to find the key with a meet-in-the-middle attack (slightly less than 10 due to the rotations, but I don't have a clean formula to hand).
There are various optimizations, but this should be enough to give you the idea. 
One thing I haven't dealt with so far is how to keep the search time down. A straightforward way to do it is simply to sort the results as you're going along. The time to insert or look for a collision with an entry is about log_2(size of the search space). Alternatively, at the cost of using more memory, it's possible to bring this search time down to a constant by reserving a block for each possible value of the first few coefficients of g1.
Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more questions.

","The RSA private key includes the values that are in the RSA public key, and some more values that are private. Futhermore, the values themselves are larger.
The public key contains the modulus and the public exponent e which is short (mostly 3 or 65537). On the other hand the private key contains the private exponent d ≡ e−1 (mod φ(n)). Depending on φ(n), d can be vastly larger than e.
There are other public key algorithms where this is different. Some algorithms based on elliptic curves have a single big integer as the private key (and group description) and the public key has a curve point (and group description) which is larger than the big integer.

why private key are often (are always, i don't know) longer than public key ? 

The answer is detailed in PKCS 1 (and friends like RFC 2437).
The public key is the pair {e, n}, where e is the public exponent and n is the modulus.
One of the private key representations is the triplet {e, d, n}, where e is the public exponent, d is the private exponent and n is the modulus.
The other private key representations the n-tuple{e, d, n, p, q, dp, dq, qi}, where e is the public exponent; d is the private exponent; n is the modulus; and p and q are the factors of n.
And the remaining are for the Chinese Remainder theorem, which allows a speedup in signatures (I believe). dp is p's exponent, a positive integer such that e(dP) ≅ 1 (mod(p-1)); dq is q's exponent, a positive integer such that e(dq) ≅ 1 (mod(q-1)); and qi is CRT coefficient, a positive integer less than p such that q(qInv) ≅ 1 (mod p).

   Provider Name:  Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0, Provider Type 1

Now i need to change this CSP type to  Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider.
Is that possible ?
And Also at what point of time it is decided that this certificate will bind/register to a CSP ? Does that occur at the time of certficate and private key creation or it happens while Signing the Certificate from CA ?
","No,
a CSP will define, among others, the key size. If you used the Base Provider to generate an RSA key it will be 512 bits will the Enhanced Provider uses 1024 bits.
This is decided at a key generation. Microsoft CAs can enforce the CSP used before signing the certificate.

It was working fine, till I got this token with a non exportable PrivateKey.

Then I use a decoder to convert the bytes array to BASE64 and post it.

String base64encoded = encoder.encode(privateKey.getEncoded());

However, using this particular token, the method getEncoded(), used on privateKey.getEncoded(), returns always null. So I didn't find a way to get the bytes array from PrivateKey object. 
Is there a possible way to do it? 
","You can't get the private key from a PKCS11 token, PKCS11 are used to have the key material inside the secure device and can't be extracted, when you want to sign with this kind of devices (HSM, smart-cards and so on)  the signature is performed inside it.
If you want to perform a signature with a client PKCS11 usb token and a applet, you have to perform the signature in the applet executed in the client machine instead of make the signature in the server side passing the key because this option it's not possible.
Hope this helps,

","Using applet is no more supported by modern browsers. Thus you need to use Browser Extension which accesses Host service running below the browser to access Certificate Store on Local machine which has handle to private key on the usb cryptographic token or smart card using CSP (Crypto Service Provider on Windows). Thus signing of hash would be done inside the token and signed content (Signature) would be returned by host application to browser which in turn sends it to server to complete signing operation.

My knowledge is that there really isn't a way to do this but I am hoping that I am wrong about this.
Edit: More description
I have generated ssh keys to log into my remote box, I have put a passphrase on the key, I want to use this key to log into the remote box with libcurl and setting CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE to the proper key file, however I would then have to set CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD because I set a passphrase, which from what I understand would have to just plain text and that just doesn't seem very secure to me. Maybe its a non-issue?
","If you want fully automated authentication then the authentication credentials must be stored somewhere.
Generally if you have root access to some machine then you can read anything including other people's private key files in their home directories.
For this reason pass phrases were introduced to encrypt those private key files on centralised storage. When you then mount a shared home directory on your own machine (on which presumably only you have root) it is safe to use the passphrase and decrypt it. The real key is then stored temporarily in memory (at which point theoretically root could access it).
If you use ssh-agent then it keeps your passphrase (needed to decrypt the keyfile) in memory which is erased on reboot and you need to reenter your passphrase.
Now if you need non interactive authentication with curl (or whatever else) then all information to get the decrypted keyfile needs to be on the machine somewhere. If you are the only one with root access to that machine then it is safe to store it without a passphrase.
If not... well then you won't get fully secure unless you wish to enter the passphrase on each access manually (and even then root could be nasty and ptrace your process to get the passphrase). In that case I suggest you put the passphrase file in volatile storage (/dev/shm for example) and deny everyone except yourself access. Root will still be able to read it though. This will need to be repeated on every reboot though.

Imported them in JKS using the below command:

When i set the JKS in weblogic i get this exception in WebLogic Server logs:

i tried changing my JKS to PKCS12 format so that i can see what my private key and alias is but that too failed with the below error:
keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.jks -srcalias certificatekey -destkeystore myp12file.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12

Problem importing entry for alias root: java.security.KeyStoreException: TrustedCertEntry not supported. 

i Then tried the java program here: keytool - see the public and private keys
But the output does not show any private keys. I used the alias mydomain. Could be the alias for the privatekey is wrong as it was populated using variables as shown in the first command of this post. What would be the solution in that case ? How could i retrieve the alias and the private key for the certificate that digisign gave me ?
If the alias is correct why am i getting error starting the weblogic server ?
Incase needed, I'm also sharing the output of 
keytool -v -list -keystore keystore.jks

Enter keystore password:

My question is therefore how do I store the private key in a database securely. (public key doesn't need to be that secure anyways).
I have two methods currently.

Add a passphrase (i.e. the user's master password) to the private key and store that as a string in the database
Encrypt the private key using a symmetric algorithm and store that as a string in the database

Are these methods sufficient? 
Which is better or are they the same thing? 
Are there any better ways?
Update
Some of you might be confused on why I want to even do this. My use case is a team based password management system. Public keys are used to encrypt a password (one for each user in a team) and private key with passphase is used to decrypt the password.
","The first option is likely better, because it's easier to mess up your own symmetric encryption implementation, than to use an existing one correctly. Passphrases on private keys usually mean just some form of symmetric encryption.
PS. I'm not sure why you're using private / public keys here. If it's for proof who uploaded the key - great. If it's for the encryption itself - why not just use symmetric encryption of the stored password instead? If all people privileged to read it know the password to the private key, then there's no big difference. The only thing you seem to gain is being able to cycle the keys without changing the passphrase everybody knows.

"28943195","Automate deployment of SSL private key using Ansible","I'm in the process of creating Ansible scripts to deploy my websites. Some of my sites use SSL for credit card transactions. I'm interested in automating the deployment of SSL as much as possible too. This means I would need to automate the distribution of the private key. In other words, the private key would have to exist in some format off the server (in revision control, for example).
How do I do this safely? Some ideas that I've come across:
1) Use a passphrase to protect the private key (http://red-badger.com/blog/2014/02/28/deploying-ssl-keys-securely-with-ansible/). This would require providing the passphrase during deployment.
2) Encrypt the private key file (aescrypt, openssl, pgp), similar to this: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18951/secure-way-to-transfer-public-secret-key-to-second-computer
3) A third option would be to generate a new private key with each deployment and try to find a certificate provider who accommodates automatic certificate requests. This could be complicated and problematic if there are delays in the process.
Have I missed any? Is there a preferred solution or anyone else already doing this?
","Another way to do this would be to use Ansible Vault to encrypt your private keys while at rest.  This would require you to provide the vault password either on the Ansible command line or from a text file or script that Ansible would read it from.
There really isn't a preferred method.  My guess is that if you asked 10 users of Ansible you'd get 10 different answers with regards to security. Since our company started using Ansible long before Ansible Vault was available we basically stored all sensitive files in local directories on servers that only our operations team has access to. At some point we might migrate to Ansible Vault since its integrated with Ansible, but we haven't gotten to that point yet.

UPDATE: I replaced ECB with CBC and hope its correct...
","You are not getting the public key with openssl_pkey_get_details(). That structure contains both the public exponent e and private exponent d. It is normal that the private key also contains the public exponent. Most of the time that is a static value (such as 65537, the fourth number of Fermat).
According to the documentation of openssl_pkey_new you can get to the public key using the method openssl_pkey_new():

openssl_pkey_new() generates a new private and public key pair. The public component of the key can be obtained using openssl_pkey_get_public().

That's not the only thing that goes wrong though:

You are not using AES. Rijndael with a block size of 256 is not AES. AES has a block size of 128 bits.
Although mcrypt always expects an IV, ECB mode does not - but read on.
ECB mode is not secure for anything other than random data, you should be using CBC mode to encrypt asymmetric keys (as they almost always contain a structure that may leak information); CBC mode does require a random IV.
You are using the ASCII representation of a string instead of an AES key; you should use a Password Based Key Derivation function such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt instead. PHP mcrypt is far too forgiving regarding insecure keys.

Note that in general I would also advise a padding mode such as PKCS#7. Mcrypt however does not implement any sane padding method, so you would have to implement that yourself.

"10642989","What, if any ""screw it up permanently"" situations are there in the App Store certificate/key-pair code signing process?","My company works with several other companies to handle their iPhone development needs, and in many cases the other companies already have some existing app(s) on the App Store. 
We handle the App Store submission for them as well and in the situations where they do already have an existing app, their iOS Dev Center account already has a Distribution certificate created. In which case we have to acquire the key pair that was generated when they (or the third party developer they hired) created the certificate. It's been my understanding this whole time that this is the necessary process in order to work with the App Store. 
But as time goes on, I find myself wondering about several things

What happens when the certificates expire? I know we create new ones but that means that the apps on the App Store are signed with a certificate/keypair different than the one they were created with. Is that significant? Or can I still update existing apps on the App Store even with a new certificate/keypair (from the same iOS Dev Center account)
What happens if the the keypair is lost for an existing certificate? Let's say the company made an app before but the Macintosh that they used prior was hit by a meteorite. And no backups of course. I'd have to revoke and recreate the certificate - would that mean anything for the existing published app? If I had the source code to that app and had to put out an update, would I be able to? 

Basically I'm asking: are there any ""screw it up permanently"" scenarios involved with iOS development and distribution certificates that would keep you from being able to update existing apps? I know that if you don't backup the keystore in Android development then you're just hosed with regards to publishing updates but is there any way to just completely screw up with iOS development?
And a bonus question: If I can just revoke development certificates and re-issue them without consequence, has it always worked this way? Or have they modified the process? I can see where the ""chain of evidence"" could always be tied to the iOS Dev Center Agent account and that would be the root of things, but is this a new thing?
","A Distribution certificate is used only for submission to iTunes Connect (and Ad Hoc stuff).  Once approved, Apple signs the app with a different non-expiring certificate before putting the app in the App store, so the state of the developer's Distribution certificate no longer matters.  
A downloaded or purchased app will stay running on a customer's device even if the developer's certificates and iOS enrollment expires.  But a developer does have to re-enroll ($99/annum) in time if they want their app to stay visible in the App store.
Typically, Distribution certificates expire annually, maybe a bit more often, new ones can be created, and an updates for existing apps can just be submitted with the newest (and valid) Distribution certificate.
If you lose a key pair, the team leader will have to revoke and the generate new certificates and provisions, and update all their Keychains and Xcode provisioning and possibly project/target settings as well.  Confusion about which certificates and provisions are live and which are dead has caused some developers some serious headaches.

","You are not correctly initializing your mechanism structure. The CK_MECHANISM is a structure that requires 3 parameters to be defined:
typedef struct CK_MECHANISM {
  CK_MECHANISM_TYPE mechanism;
  CK_VOID_PTR       pParameter;
  CK_ULONG          ulParameterLen;  /* in bytes */
} CK_MECHANISM;

You need to initialize your mechanism as follow:
CK_MECHANISM  mechanism = { CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP, NULL_PTR, 0 };

CK_MECHANISM  GenMechanism = { CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN, NULL_PTR, 0 };

Then you need to initialize your mechanism for decryption as follow:
CK_MECHANISM  mechanism   = { CKM_RSA_PKCS, NULL_PTR, 0};

I presume you are already logged in with your hsession and the hObject is the located private key to be used for decryption?

It seems like the encrypted private key is not in the right format, but I save it in DER PKCS#8 format.
So, the question: What is the mistake in this code?
","I guess the problem is that you write an Object, but then you read byte[] (not an Object)
I would suggest that you either read the whole object and then get the required bytes or even better write byte[] directly (don't use ObjectOutputStream) and then load these bytes, eg:
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(PRIVATE_KEY_FILE);
fos.write(myByteArray);
fos.close();

and then to retrieve it:
byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(PRIVATE_KEY_FILE));

","Are you using Android Keystore to store the keys or using your own file storage? 
Android keystore
With Android Keystore there is no way to recover keys because they can only be used by the application that created them and are discarded if there are substantial changes. 
I guess you are using the RSA keys to negotiate an AES symmetric encryption key. Therefore you will need to backup the AES encryption key( for example in the server...),  and stablish a mechanism to recover the key like the common ""remember password"" utilities
custom key storage
If you are storing the keys into the device without AndroidKeystore, you could define your own mechanism to restore the keys. For example, encrypt the key with a password and storing the key into a public directory of the device. Then the key can be recovered prompting user for the password
Note: Take into account the security risks in each case. For example a non-encrypted AES keys into server implies that a malicious server could decrypt messages. Or a weak recovery key mechanism will descrease the whole security level of the system

"41051342","Getting algid parse error when converting from String to Public Key/Private Key","I currently have a public/private key pair in as two separate strings that I am trying to convert back into public/private key format. 
I am currently reading in the string from a .auth file, not a public key file and private key file so I can't use openssl pkcs8 -topk8... to get rid of the algid parse error. I am reading in the keys like so:
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(authFileName));
String publicK = br.readLine();
String privateK = br.readLine();
br.close();

From there, I am converting the files back into byte arrays like so using the Base64 Decoder like so:
byte[] privateBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(privateK);
byte[] publicBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(publicK);

Lastly I am converting those byte arrays into Public and Private keys using a key factory. Here is the code:
KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PrivateKey privateKey = keyFactory.generatePrivate(new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privateBytes));
PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicBytes));

When my code tries to generate the private and public keys using the key factory, that is when it throws the InvalidKeyException algid parse error
I have looked online and noticed many people saying adding the following line to my code should fix the problem:
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());

But it didn't. Is there any other solution, besides bouncy castle and openssl, that I should try that worked for anyone else?

I've seen lots of sites using

but in my keystore when i look at the certs all of the private keys do not exist. 
// this is how i setup the store 
public cryptTest(string storeName)

Write

on gpg consoler and press ENTER two times for new password.
Then
     gpg --export-secret-keys KEY_NAME > KEY_FILE

"17798341","Consecutive OpenSSL PKCS12 generation yields different private key content","When using the same key and certificate file to create a PKCS12 (PKCS#12 / p12) file, I noticed that consecutive calls to OpenSSL's pkcs12 capability yields different ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY content each time (I'm also using the same import password and PEM passphrase). Is this supposed to happen?  I'm guessing it has something to do with a different IV (initialization vector) or salt related to a symmetric encryption of the private key, but I wanted to be sure.
I use the following command to create the cred1.p12 and cred2.p12 files:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in certs/cert.pem -out cred1.p12 -name ""My credentials"" -inkey private/key.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -in certs/cert.pem -out cred2.p12 -name ""My credentials"" -inkey private/key.pem

When I compare the resulting .p12 files (diff cred1.p12 cred2.p12 results in binary differences) I use the following command to create the two PKCS12 info text files, upon which I perform another diff.
 openssl pkcs12 -info -in cred1.p12 > a.txt
 openssl pkcs12 -info -in cred2.p12 > b.txt
 diff a.txt b.txt

And the only differences lie between the -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- tags where the private key content is held. 
Thanks in advance!
","Yes, this is expected behavior. OpenSSL uses DES-EDE3 by default for encrypting the private key in a PKCS12 file. Each time you encrypt it's generating a random initialization vector, which will change the encrypted payload. When you look at the -info output you'll see something like this:
DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,558C30D119D6944F

The data after the comma is the hex encoded 8 byte salt.

","You will need to convert your .NET XML format key to a .PEM in order for it to be handled by any Python modules.  (See this question)
Once you have that, you could use the RSA or PyCrypto modules.
Check out this example code for signing data using PyCrypto:
def sign_data(private_key_loc, data):
    '''
    param: private_key_loc Path to your private key
    param: package Data to be signed
    return: base64 encoded signature
    '''
    from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA 
    from Crypto.Signature import PKCS1_v1_5 
    from Crypto.Hash import SHA256 
    from base64 import b64encode, b64decode 
    key = open(private_key_loc, ""r"").read() 
    rsakey = RSA.importKey(key) 
    signer = PKCS1_v1_5.new(rsakey) 
    digest = SHA256.new() 
    # It's being assumed the data is base64 encoded, so it's decoded before updating the digest 
    digest.update(b64decode(data)) 
    sign = signer.sign(digest) 
    return b64encode(sign)

Obviously, it will need to be adapted to your needs (Use import SHA instead of import SHA256 if you need SHA-1, for example), but it should give you a good head-start.

"28925937","Decrypt SSL with Private Key","If an attacker gets your SSL Private Key , what can he do with it ? can he decrypt the SSL traffic ? if yes , HOW ?
And what should the Admin do to prevent such an attack  ? 
","If an adversary obtains your private key, they could:

Execute a man-in-the-middle attack and read all traffic between client and server.
Decrypt SSL/TLS sessions that were not established using a key exchange method that provides forward secrecy.  This attack simply requires observing (or replaying previously observed) traffic on the wire.  Wireshark provides an ""SSL dissector"" feature that, given a private key, decrypts current or recorded TLS sessions.  This Stack Overflow question demonstrates how forward secrecy prevents this kind of analysis.
Attempt to trick a certificate authority (one that is trusted by clients) into signing a certificate binding the public key to your domain name, and impersonate you directly using this certificate (provided they can cause clients to come to them using e.g. phishing, DNS poisoning, etc.)

To protect your private key:

Always store the private key in encrypted form, using a strong cipher and strong passphrase.
Ensure it can only be read by the processes that need to read it.  Set appropriate file ownership and permissions, and consider additional Mandatory Access Control mechanisms such as SELinux to restrict which processes can access it.
If your servers are long running, consider not storing your private key on the server host at all, as it is most likely needed only at server startup.
If your service handles sensitive or high-value data, consider using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for signing and decryption operations so that the private key cannot be exfiltrated.

You should also take measures to limit the impact of a key disclosure:

Favour (or use exclsively) key agreement protocols that provide forward secrecy, so that captured sessions cannot be decrypted later if the private key is disclosed.
Be prepared to revoke keys when you believe they may have been compromised, and deploy new certificates with new keys.
DNSSEC can help protect against MitM and impersonation attacks (if clients use it).
DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE), in conjunction with DNSSEC, allows you to specify the trust anchor for certificates which, if clients query and validate DANE TLSA records, protects clients from communicating with servers presenting certificates signed by other CAs.

"39134657","CryptographicException in RSA.ImportParameters() - Bad Data in special 1024 keys","We have a C#/.Net 4.0 application which imports RSA Private Keys from a String in Base64 received in a WebService.
This application works perfectly for RSA-Keys in 1024 bits, but doesn't with a special kind of rsa private keys (around 1% of keys).
Here are the byte lengths:
Working-Key:

Modulus => 128 Bytes 
Exponent => 3 Bytes
D => 128 Bytes
P => 64 Bytes
Q => 64 Bytes 
DP => 64 Bytes 
DQ => 64 Bytes 
IQ => 64 Bytes

Not-Working-Key:

Modulus => 128 Bytes 
Exponent => 3 Bytes
D => 127 Bytes
P => 64 Bytes
Q => 64 Bytes 
DP => 64 Bytes 
DQ => 64 Bytes 
IQ => 64 Bytes

The difference is in the lenght of D (128 working, 127 not working). The not-working key is 1 byte shorter than the working key. 
The parameters are set but when doing RSA.ImportParameters(rsaParams) it throws a CryptographicException with a ""Bad Data"" Message. 
What should be included to solve this problem?
","RSACryptoServiceProvider has some assumptions on the data lengths which are:

Modulus: any even size, let's call the length n
Exponent: (<= 4 bytes; though RSACng allows ""any size""), let's call the length e
D: n
P: n/2
Q: n/2
DP: n/2
DQ: n/2
InverseQ: n/2

So, assuming that your second key is actually Modulus: 128 bytes (because a 64-byte P times a 64-byte Q isn't a 256 byte number), you just need to left-pad the D array with a zero to bring it up to the proper length.
byte[] newD = new byte[modulus.Length];
Buffer.BlockCopy(d, 0, newD, newD.Length - d.Length, d.Length);

.NET Core has the source code available showing that relationship.  In .NET Framework it's buried inside the CLR, so not available on referencesource.

KeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PrivateKey pk = kf.generatePrivate(spec);
jws.setKey(kf.generatePrivate(spec));

But I get this error message
java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.security.InvalidKeyException: invalid key format    

I think it is because the cert was created as SHA256 instead of RSA.  Here is how I was told the cert was created:
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 730 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate_pub.crt

Does anyone have any examples of how I could sign JWT with a SHA256 cert?
","With additional info, that private key file is PEM but NOT PKCS#8, as a modern version of OpenSSL should have created for req -newkey. And the difference between PEM and ""DER"" (binary) which standard Java requires is not just removing (and adding) the BEGIN and END lines.
Your simplest solution if OpenSSL is available is to convert both of these, without encrypting:
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -outform der -in private.pem -out good.der 

Then read good.der (use better name if you like) as bytes, and put that in PKCS8EncodedKeySpec and use it as you posted. Aside: you don't need to fiddle with DataInputStream, which isn't really intended for ""plain old"" bytes; java.nio.file.Files.readAllBytes can open, allocate, and read for you.
The next more complicated alternative is to convert to PKCS#8 but still PEM: same as about but omit -outform der (and use a file name that indicates PEM, to avoid confusion). Then in Java read that file as characters (with a Reader, usually BufferedReader, not a Stream), discard the BEGIN and END lines, concatenate all the lines between, and convert them from base64 to byte[]: in Java8 you have java.util.Base64, before that you can use javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter. 
To read the file you have in standard Java is harder. You could read the PEM-armored PKCS#1 and convert to binary PKCS#1, then ""wrap"" the PKCS#1 into PKCS#8 by building the DER encoding, but that's a good bit more complicated than what you've demonstrated familiarity with. Or you could parse the PKCS#1 and use the components to construct your own implemenation of RSAPrivateCrtKey and use that directly (no factory), ditto. 
The other alternative is to use the third-party library from http://www.BouncyCastle.org which has more flexible features for handling PEM files than standard Java. But you need to learn their API as well as the standard one, and if your program will run anywhere else you need to ensure BC is deployed with or as part of your program.

EDIT: People seem to disagree with the ""Interchangeable"" definition. I need to clarify that I am talking about the mathematical perspective of the operation, not what is best in terms of security. Ofc, you should use keys for their intended operation.
However, Henrick Hellström response in SO thread explains why they are interchangeable mathematically : Are public key and private key interchangeable?

","Not only can you use a public key for encryption, that is actually the normal mode of operation when you are encrypting for secrecy.  This makes sense - anyone can encrypt with the public key, and only the proper recipient can decrypt using their private key.
In many public key systems, signing is mathematically similar to the opposite case - ""encrypting with the private key"" - but note that the signing operation is fundamentally distinct from the encryption operation.  For example, with RSA, signing must use an invariant, verifiable padding method, whereas encryption should use random padding.

","Encryption is about keeping some data confidential; the data is transformed into an opaque blob and the reverse operation requires something that the attacker does not know, i.e. a ""secret"" or ""private"" information. The whole point of encryption is that decryption cannot be done with only public information; hence decryption uses the private key. However, there is no problem in letting anybody encrypt data, thus encryption can use the public key.
There are some algorithms (in practice, only one: RSA) which, from a casual glance, appear to be ""revertible"": you might think about using the private key for encryption, and the public key for decryption. As explained above, there goes confidentiality (if the decryption key is public, then anybody can decrypt, hence the encrypted data cannot be considered as confidential anymore). Such a ""reversed encryption"" may be used as the basis for a digital signature algorithm, in which there is no notion of confidentiality, but, instead, of verifiable proof of key owner action.
However there is more to RSA than the modular exponentiation. RSA encryption first transforms the input message into a big integer through an operation called ""padding"". RSA signature generation first transforms the input message into a big integer through another operation which is also called ""padding""; but this is not at all the same padding. Padding is essential for security, and the needed characteristics are quite distinct between encryption and signature. For instance, an encryption padding needs a high level of added randomness, whereas a signature padding requires a lot of redundancy (and a hash function, in order to accommodate long input messages).
Talking of signatures as ""encryption with the private key"" is the way the RSA standard historically put it (hence names such as ""md5WithRSAEncryption""), but it is inaccurate (paddings are, and must be, different) and overly specific (it applies only to RSA, not El Gamal, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, NTRU...). This is just a widespread confusion.

How are they different? What different functions do they have?
","You need to read a good tutorial on SSH, but here is a summary:
The Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are like a username and password. They allow you to ""do stuff"" on the AWS API using the commandline tools or code you write.
The private key (.pem) is like a password for talking (SSH) to an individual box that you have launched. (i.e. not ""AWS itself"", but ""your box within AWS"".) You can have different passwords to different boxes if you want, but most of the time you only need one.
If you know how SSH works, they are just putting down ~/.ssh/known_hosts with the public part of your key, allowing you to log in for the first time. You can change that file later to add more users or rotate your SSH keys.

","Your code does not properly decode the base64 data:
privateKeyPEM contains the String data between the BEGIN and END data (which is base64 encoded).
Your code does the following:
byte[] privateKeyBytes = privateKeyPEM.getBytes();
// privateKeyBytes now contains the base64 encoded key data

String encodedString = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(privateKeyBytes);
// encoded String contains now the base64 encoded data of the base64 encoded key data

byte[] decodedString = Base64.getDecoder().decode(encodedString);
// decodedString is not the base64 encoded data of your key data

Why are you encoding the data base64 and then in the next line decoding it - both steps together are just useless.
What you really need is to apply the base64 decode one time onto privateKeyPEM:
byte[] keyData = Base64.getDecoder().decode(privateKeyPEM);
EncodedKeySpec privKeySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(keyData);

If the base64 decode fails then your base64 data is invalid - most likely because of contained spaces or \r.

I successfully get the key; however, when trying to get the private key within the object using key.PrivateKey, I get the following error: OpenCSP failed with error code 2148073494.  Looking up the Windows error 2148073494, I get nte_bad_keyset.  It looks like there have been errors around other situations that throw this same error here, but they closed that bug as fixed.  When I run this bit of code in a console app, it works fine and it also works fine in my test environment running under IISExpress.  When run in a production environment under IIS, I get this error every time.  I've tried running under the context of an admin user just to make sure it wasn't an odd permission error, same thing.  From what I understand about this Windows error, is that Windows gave me where the key lives, then told me there is nothing at that address.  I'm using ""System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms"": ""4.3.0"" for this.
EDIT: I should note that as part of my testing, I actually grabbed the exact certificate I'm looking for from the production environment onto my test environment and it loaded fine.  I also ran the console app on the production environment pulling the same key and it worked fine.
","Ultimately, the answer is ""something deleted the private key after importing it to the certificate store"" (or, maybe it's possible to confuse Windows into remembering where a key lives despite it not actually living there).
If you know that it, for example, works for a little while then stops:

Seeing that it's in ""Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider"", turn to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb204778(v=vs.85).aspx and see that the keyfile will be located at %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys.  The Unique container name happens to be the name of the file it'll have.
So, open that directory, right click on the file.

That will tell you what process/user did the delete operation... and maybe that'll be enough to identify what went wrong.
You could presumably do the private key file identification and audit registration more programmatically; but this was the quickest way I knew to explain it.

","That's just a nonsense.
Password and private key represent two different authentication methods. You cannot convert one to the other.
Either you authenticate with a password. Or you authenticate with a private key. The private key is typically stored in a file.

","The most obvious issue is that you are repeatedly reseeding the system random number generator with the same value, e.g.
srand( (unsigned) getpid());
sd=rand();
mpz_set_ui(seed, sd);
gmp_randseed(stat, seed);

Don't do this. You end up getting the same random number each time, and it's likely that reusing the same numbers for multiple purposes is giving bad results.

Using base64_encode() on $encrypted would prevent data loss from database encoding.
However, there are a lot of other things you're doing wrong that affect the security of your scheme rather than merely prevent it from functioning.

I have to use sendTransaction() function in javascript code but it needs the privateKey to sign. Now I'm storing the privateKey as static and I think is quite dangerous. 
I'm figuring out to hide my owner public and private key in the code. Please let me know If anyone have great idea. Thank you so much. 
","First of all this line of code var publicKey = web3.eth.getAccounts(); doesn't return you the public key, it returns you an array of addresses.
You could use the npm package keythereum.
It extracts the private Key from your Keystore-File by passing the specific address. First you use the importFromFile function to import it and then use the recover function to extract the private key.
It would look like this:
var keystorePath = ""/yourPathToTheKeystoreFile"";

async function importPrivateKey(address) {
let methodName = "">>> [importPrivateKey]: "";
  try{

      var keyObject = await keythereum.importFromFile(address, keystorePath);

      return privateKey;


    }catch(e) {
      console.log(e);
      throw e;
    }

Now you can just call this function directly in any other function and use the extracted private key directly as a new parameter for the sendTransactionfunction without storing the private Key in any variable.

","You need a private key, plain and simple. Otherwise, what are you going to sign it with? The signature field of an X.509 cert is mandatory.
I mean, if all you want is a public key, you don't need to bother with the X.509 overhead. You can just pony up a public key that looks like this:
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

But X.509 is more than just a public key - it's a signed public key. Technically, a CSR is, too, but CSR's are always self-signed whereas X.509 certs can be signed by anyone.

If the intention was really to encrypt it, it should have been encrypted with the public key.
Possibly however the intention was to sign it, in which case what you have to do is verify it against the public key. For which you need the public key, which is in the certificate. So you load the certificate into a Certificate, using the java.security.cert API and then use a java.security.Signature object to verify the signature with, using the public key obtained from the Certificate.

"31409720","Using Bitcoin-ruby to make a transaction","I originally posted this question on the bitcoin stack but was told I may have better luck reposting it here. 
I am having trouble with the bitcoin-ruby gem. I get the following error when trying to send money to another address I have on the test network:

/var/lib/gems/2.2.0/gems/bitcoin-ruby-0.0.7/lib/bitcoin/protocol/txout.rb:76:in
  pk_script=': undefined methodbytesize' for nil:NilClass
  (NoMethodError)

I am generating a private key with:
def new_address
 Bitcoin::generate_address
end

And getting details for the private key with:
def key_details(prikey, pubkey)
  #returns prikey, prikey_hash58, pubkey_hash58, pubkey_uncompressed, address as a hash
  my_key = Bitcoin::Key.new(prikey, pubkey)
  { prikey:prikey, 
    prikey_base58:my_key.to_base58, 
    pubkey_58:my_key.hash160, 
    pubkey: my_key.pub_uncompressed, 
    address:my_key.addr
  }
end

The code I have to send money to myself is as follows: 
require 'bitcoin'
require_relative 'utilities.rb'
require 'open-uri'

Bitcoin.network = :testnet3

def build_transaction(prev_tx, prev_out_index, key, value, addr, message)
  include Bitcoin::Builder

  new_tx = build_tx do |t|
    t.input do |i|
      i.prev_out prev_tx
      i.prev_out_index prev_out_index
      i.signature_key key
    end
    t.output do |o|
      o.value value 
      o.script {|s| s.type :address; s.recipient addr }
    end
  end
end

def prev_tx(prev_hash, network)
  if network == ""testnet3""
    prev_tx = Bitcoin::P::Tx.from_json(open(""http://test.webbtc.com/tx/#{prev_hash}.json""))
  else
    prev_tx = Bitcoin::P::Tx.from_json(open(""http://webbtc.com/tx/#{prev_hash}.json""))
  end
end

def key(publ_key, priv_key)
  key = Bitcoin::Key.new(priv_key, publ_key)
end

def bin_to_hex(s)
  s.unpack('H*').first
end

#transaction inputs
priv_key = ""private_key""
publ_key = ""public_key_long_format""
address = ""address""
previous_tx = ""previous_tx_hash""

# generate tx info off inputs
key = Bitcoin::Key.new(priv_key, publ_key)
prev_tx = prev_tx(previous_tx, ""testnet3"")
prev_out_index = 1
tx_value = prev_tx.outputs[prev_out_index].value

# build new tx
tx = build_transaction(prev_tx, prev_out_index, key, tx_value, address, ""hello"")

#
# puts tx.to_json
puts bin_to_hex(tx.to_payload)

Does anyone know how to solve this error?
","It turned out to be a couple of issues. Here is what I learned along the way:
The tx json data that is used to build the prev_tx object needs to have a output value as a string. Some sites use a number instead.
The key object sometimes doesn't form correctly. For whatever reason, I have an address which can only be generated using the private key with Bitcoin::Key.new. If you supply a private and public key the address associated with the key object is wrong. For different addresses, this isn't the case. So it is important to check the address of the key object after generating the object. 
It is also important to make sure the addresses / keys generated on testnet3 are only used with one another. I had a situation where I thought I generated a testnet3 private key, but didn't. Thus, the testnet3 tx wasn't working. And vice versa for the normal bitcoin network.
Lastly, it's very important to verify the output address position. It is usually 0 or 1, but this isn't always the case...

","If you are REALLY paranoid about security, you do not store the private key on the filesystem, you store it in hardware.  A Hardware Security Module (HSM) from a company like SafeNet or Thales/nCipher is a physically hardened security appliance that is designed to product encryption keys.  Once the keys are generated on the HSM they cannot be removed.  That is, you can not extract the key and copy it off somewhere else to be used for malicious purposes.  Additionally, they have hardened operating systems and software designed to prevent an attacker from being able to hack into the appliance.  Too many unsuccessful logins?  The device securely wipes its contents.  Try to pry open the box to remove the flash memory holding the keys?  There is epoxy on the physical hardware components and you will end up destroying them.
These devices also typically include cryptographic accelerators to increase the speed at which cryptographic operations are performed.  They also tend to include standards-based APIs, such as PKCS#11 or JCE so it is easy to integrate with other software, such as Apache or your Java JVM.
An HSM is not cheap, but if you are really concerned about the security of your cryptographic material, this is how you protect it.

","You don't EVER read the private key back from a keystore, this would defeat the point of putting it in the keystore to start with. You pass in the data you want encrypting/signing to the keystore and it gives you back the encrypted/signed data.

One issue I am facing is OpenSSH-server generated keys (Pub and private), must be generated after installation through command ssh-keygen...

They are generated after the installation for a reason. And that reason is certainly that they should not go to anyone else (from there is the private word). But they are Host keys.

However, I have to pass explicit and plain-text password, which I would like to avoid.

Why? You can store your public key on them and you would be still able to connect with your private key, which will be still safe.

I would like to know if I can share same private and public keys to everyone, so that I can remote connect on them? In this way, I can generate keys only once and seed it through post-script installation using preseed.

You can, but it is certainly not advised and fail-prone technique possibly leading to the compromised security.

        }
    }

In both cases is like the encrypter methods are looking for the private key (in the client client????)... So, My question is why this examples are using private keys in the client-side, if the Wikipedia says this:

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
And in several cases I found what I think is right:
https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt/examples/jwt-with-rsa-encryption
In this Java example, this uses public key to encrypt data, not private one.
I don't know why C# examples are using private keys in the client-side, this is ilogical, can somebody explain me why, and how can I solve this problems?
","I have found an answer for one of the two problems I have, and is that I haven't readed completely the JOSE-JWT repo, it says:
var payload = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    { ""sub"", ""mr.x@contoso.com"" },
    { ""exp"", 1300819380 }
};

var publicKey=... //Load it from there you need

string token = Jose.JWT.Encode(payload, publicKey, JweAlgorithm.RSA_OAEP, JweEncryption.A256GCM);

I have realized tha Bouncy Castle is only a API to manipulate public-private keys, the encryptation-decrypting work is done by JOSE-JWT. So, my question is solved.

","Signing a message does not make it unreadable, so there is no ""recovery"" step required. The signature is a little bit of extra data that may be in the same file or may be stored separately. The signature allows the reader of the message to verify who wrote the message (via the public key that validates the signature) and that the message has not been altered.
If you want to give someone your signed message, you give them the clear-text message and the signature. They can then use your public key to validate the signature. The signature is based on a digest of the message and your private key. The validation step computes the digest of the message and validates the signature of the digest with the public key. If either the public key doesn't correspond to the private key used in the signature, or if the message digest doesn't match, then the signature is detected as invalid.
A related operation would by to encrypt a message. This definitely makes the message unreadable. The encryption would be with a public key and only the holder of the associated private key would be able to decrypt the message.

","You will need to create a key store and import your private key enerated by EC2.
Then you will need to create a trust store and import the EC2's certificate there.
The difference between keystore and trustore is described here.
Once you have your keystore and truststore ready you can, for example, install the Security plugin to VisualVM and use the security configuration dialogue in the options to use the stores to communicate with secured servers. Or you can follow that guide you found for JConosole.

","I've had a similar error trying to construct a X509Certificate2 from a byte array - worked fine locally but once I deploy to Azure Web App, I got the same and VERY misleading file not found exception.
The real issue turned out to be that there was no user store associated with the web service account. You can also get a similar error if there are permission-related errors with accessing the certificate store on Windows.
In any case - In my scenario I fixed the problem by using MachineKeySet:
new X509Certificate2(certRawBytes, default(string), X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet);
So, in your scenario, try something like:
var keyParams = new CngKeyCreationParameters
{
  KeyCreationOptions = CngKeyCreationOptions.MachineKey,
};
CngKey.Create(CngAlgorithm.Rsa, keyName, keyParams);

Note: You may have to set a few parameters to get the above working. The Import method doesn't seem to support MachineKey - but you should be able to achieve similar outcome by using the Create method.

"3965162","iPhone: how/whether to include my existing private key in a new certificate?","Short version:
Is it necessary or even possible for me to generate a new distribution certificate based on my existing private key, or is there no harm, both for new apps and updates to existing apps on the app store, to generate a new certificate with a new private key?
Long version:
It seems to me that there is conflicting/misleading information in the iPhone Developer Program User Guide regarding private keys and distribution certificate expiration.
On the one hand, it says that you should guard your private key with your life, and keep a copy of it so that you can use it on a new machine if you change developer machines. My understanding was that somehow you must hold onto your one true private key (i.e., the first one you generate for your company when requesting your first certificate), and use it forever (at least, use it forever once you've deployed an app with it to the App Store).
On the other hand, it tells you that distribution certificates expire after one year and you can simply request a new distribution certificate when you need one. What would make sense to me would be if they followed that with a paragraph that started ""Because it is critical for you to use your original private key when requesting your new certificate, here is how you request a certificate that is created from a pre-existing private key..."" But there is no such paragraph and after searching I haven't heard of a way to do that.
There is this closely related post on stackoverflow: Lost Private Key For iPhone Distribution Certificate. What could be solutions?
The answers to that question seem to indicate that when a distribution certificate is lost or expired, you can revoke it and create a new one and there is no affect on your apps currently on the app store, and you can continue to publish new apps with your new certificate without Apple saying ""Hey, you aren't the same company as before.""
One key question left unanswered by that post is whether it's possible to update existing apps on the app store using a different cert/key than the one the apps were previously published under. But I have heard elsewhere that that's possible also.
So it boils down to: Is it misleading for Apple to make it sound like your private key is really the thing that identifies an app as being from your company? Is it really just your app id plus your credentials for logging in to the development portal and itunesconnect that identify your company and your apps?
","You can generate a new private key, and use it with no interruptions to your applications. I know this from first-hand-experience - as I lost my key and had to invalidate it, and regenerate a new one - after which I needed to sign an update to two of my existing applications (signed with the old key) - and submit the for updates to the AppStore.
There were not disruptions - either to existing apps after the key was revoked - or to the new updates, after people updated them. No user-data in the application was lost during the application update either. So in-short, everything was completely seamless.
There was one topic being discussed whether push notifications would continue to work properly (if you app uses them). I can't speak for that, though.

So what's the point of making an another account a member ""App Manager"" if I can't distribute from our account? 
Is this the correct approach ?
This issue has been bugging me lately I'd appreciate any help.
Thanks 
","The role only determines what you can do in iTunes Connect.  Apple does not want you private key, because with it, Apple could build an app as your company and users installing the app would basically trust it as if it were built by you.  Or worse, if Apple's dev site gets hacked and the private keys were all stolen, I could build a Facebook app as if I were Facebook.  The private key should be protected by the development organization and Apple should not have access to that file.  
Separately, you may have an organization that has a group who builds the application for deployment versus a group who actually submits the app for release to Apple.  Many big IT organizations work this way.  In this case, your development team is given the private key, cert, and profile, and will generate the signed binary for submitting to the app store.  They could not actually submit it to the store however.  They provide the app binary to the deployment team, who has an App Manager role.  That user would then submit to Apple.
You simply need to explain that you cannot create a signed binary for distribution without the private key that is part of the signing identity.  If they want to control the private key, have them create the build with the signing identity and send it to you for deployment.  If they can't do the build themselves, you need the private key to do it for them.

"34812287","How do I convert an array object to a string object in PowerShell?","While trying to create an CSV file with information about certificates I have an issue to store the userrights on the private key.
The problem is that I want to store multiple values in one attribute so I use an array. 
At first I had no errors, however the column in my csv-file remained empty even in the case where the array has a value.
With a simple Write-Host I can see my array has the expected value so this part works okay. 
For further investigations I have added the line:
Get-Member $certs.GetValue(""UserRights"")

This gives an error indicating I have to convert my variable to a string-variable.

So next I have tried to convert this array to a single string.
I have tried several ways but my error doesn't disappear so it doesn't work.
Underneath is my full code with some former attempts commented.
cls $certs = Get-ChildItem cert:\LocalMachine -Recurse  | Where-Object {-not $_.PSIsContainer} | Select * Write-Host (""There were {0} certificates"" -f ($certs | Measure-Object).Count)

    Export-CSV c:\Certificaten\Localcerts_$env:COMPUTERNAME.csv

","As noted in the comments, Get-Member is probably not what you're looking for
You (almost certainly) don't want to add the UserRights member property to the $Certs array, but rather to the individual objects in $Certs. 
(I removed a bunch of superfluous Write-Host statements for readability):
$CertsAmended = foreach($Certificate in $certs)
{
    if($certificate.HasPrivateKey)
    {
        $rsaFile = $certificate.PrivateKey.CspKeyContainerInfo.UniqueKeyContainerName
        $fullPath = ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\"" + $rsaFile
        $acl = Get-Acl -Path $fullPath

        # Create the UserRights value using -join
        $UserRechten = @(foreach($accessrule in $acl.Access){
            Write-Host ""User"" $accessrule.IdentityReference ""has the following rights:"" $accessrule.FileSystemRights
            ""{0}:{1}"" -f ($accessrule.IdentityReference,$accessrule.FileSystemRights)
        }) -join "";""

        # Add the property to the individual object
        $Certificate | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name ""UserRights"" -Value $UserRechten

        Write-Host ""Userrights: "" $UserRechten

        # ""Drop"" the certificate object (now with a UserRights value) back onto the pipeline
        $Certificate
    } 
} 

Now you can export the $CertsAmended array to CSV all you want

If you find the $var = @(foreach($item in $collection){}) -join ';' displeasing to the eye, break it into two statements:
$UserRechten = foreach($accessrule in $acl.Access)
{
    # Create UserRight string here, without ;
}
$UserRechten = $UserRechten -join ';'


For the $fullPath variable, you may want to use the Join-Path cmdlet:
$fullPath = Join-Path ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\"" $rsaFile

  Right?

No, that's mean that you can upload a beta or alpha without have an APK in production. For example if you want to test your app before going into production you can publish a beta app and understand if there are any problems.
Once you publish an APK (alpha, beta, production) you need to use the same certificate.

"3838693","Using .snk's private key to sign arbitrary data","I'm developing a .NET package manager and one thing that got me thinking is security. 
Given that anybody can potentially upload an assembly to the repository, how do I verify that said assembly comes from a trusted source? For example, I'd trust NHibernate.dll much more if it was signed with a private key of guys from NHForge. To ensure this, all I'd have to do is to verify assembly signature with NHForges' public key.
Now, with that in mind, how can one establish this relationship (that this particular public key belongs to this particular person)? An idea I came up with is as follows:

Project author creates an XML file which contains information about the project and about an author (name, email, etc)
This XML file is signed with authors' private key extracted from a .snk file which is later used to sign the assembly itself
Author uploads this signed XML file to the repository, where it gets checked and a relationship between an author and a public key is established

To implement this (is this a viable idea, BTW?), I need a programmatic way of accessing .snk files and reading PK. Is there something for this in .NET?
","First off, strong names should not be used as a security mechanism—they are only intended to be used as an assembly identity mechanism. For something like this, I'd look into Authenticode, which was specifically designed for verifying the publisher/source of an assembly (i.e. security instead of just identity).
That being said, the idea you outlined wouldn't be feasible as-is because you can't strong name sign an XML file—strong name signing only works on .NET assemblies. Theoretically, what you could do is maintain some kind of mapping for each public key to a specific publisher (perhaps through a publisher registration process or something?), and then verify assemblies' strong name signatures before they are added to the repository.
As for the technical aspect, you can extract the public key from a .snk file via the StrongNameGetPublicKey function (which is part of the unmanaged strong naming API). You'll have to load the .snk file into memory yourself, though.

","Just as with public-key cryptography, you occasionally need to use a hybrid scheme when the data exceeds a certain size - you can encrypt the private key using a normal symmetric algorithm with a random key, and then split the symmetric key using a secret-splitting algorithm of choice.
I believe that the implementation here: https://github.com/moserware/SecretSplitter uses this method to split data that exceeds the size limit of the underlying splitting algorithm.

Crypto++ offers the functionality. But the license is Public Domain (individual source files) or Boost Software 1.0 (library as a whole). Its not GNU/GPL.
Here's the code to do it from Crypto++. It was taken from test.cpp:
Splitting
void SecretShareFile(int threshold, int nShares, const char *filename, const char *seed)
{
    RandomPool rng;
    rng.IncorporateEntropy((byte *)seed, strlen(seed));

    ChannelSwitch *channelSwitch;
    FileSource source(filename, false, new SecretSharing(rng,
        threshold, nShares, channelSwitch = new ChannelSwitch));

    vector_member_ptrs<FileSink> fileSinks(nShares);
    string channel;
    for (int i=0; i<nShares; i++)
    {
        char extension[5] = "".000"";
        extension[1]='0'+byte(i/100);
        extension[2]='0'+byte((i/10)%10);
        extension[3]='0'+byte(i%10);
        fileSinks[i].reset(new FileSink((string(filename)+extension).c_str()));

        channel = WordToString<word32>(i);
        fileSinks[i]->Put((byte *)channel.data(), 4);
        channelSwitch->AddRoute(channel, *fileSinks[i], DEFAULT_CHANNEL);
    }

    source.PumpAll();
}

Combining
void SecretRecoverFile(int threshold, const char *outFilename, char *const *inFilenames)
{
    SecretRecovery recovery(threshold, new FileSink(outFilename));

    vector_member_ptrs<FileSource> fileSources(threshold);

The application uses a self-signed certificate, which I created with makecert.exe. So the PFX, CER and PVK are there and available. Everything works fine.
At this point of time and only for testing, the application reads the certificate and the private key from an embedded resource. That means both are compiled into the application, which is a high security risk.
I already know, that the most common way to store this data, is the windows certificate store. And I also know, how to save and read from the windows certificate store.
But there is something, that I still do not get:
Where do I store the private key (PVK) for the certificate (CER), so that my application is able to use the CER?
I mean, if my application can read it, then anybody, who has access to this machine, can read it. Or is this wrong?
Do I have to take care myself or is there any ""industry standard"" for windows machines, to save and read the PVK?
","Windows certificate store is the most common place to store certificates (i.e. CA) or certificates with private key (End entity).
If you store certificate ( with private key - PFX) in LocalMachine\My store then you can assign privileges who (what account) can access private key. It is done through certlm.msc tool. System account has access by default so any system service can use the private key.
There are other ways to store private key (like smartcard, HSM, net HSM etc.) and other ways to access private key (like PKCS#11).

","The structure of the OPENSSL version is different from the ANDROID one.
See both data structures in the online ASN.1 decoder: 
RSA_ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY_ANDROID_GENERATED
RSA_ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY_OPENSSL_GENERATED
Therefore I assume that the OPENSSL version is not a valid PKCS#8 structure, only a subset containing the PrivateKey structure. 
May be you executed the wrong command using OpenSSL, if I read the documentation correct it creates by default a PKCS#1 structure. If you want a PKCS#8 strcusture you have to convert it later using openssl pkcs8 .. command.

Somewhere in the print will be base64 encoded private key.
Also, try checking your JCE provider which encoding it uses.

","There are several formats for private key storage. Among them are PKCS#1 and PKCS#8. They differ in encryption algorithms and ASN.1 structure. Also, PKCS#8 supports other key algorithms besides RSA.
For example this is the ASN.1 dump of the first bytes of an unencrypted PKCS#8 file:
0000  4BE: SEQUENCE {
0004    1:   INTEGER 0
0007    D:   SEQUENCE {
0009    9:     OBJECT IDENTIFIER rsaEncryption (1 2 840 113549 1 1 1)
         :       (PKCS #1)
0014    0:     NULL
         :     }
0016  4A8:   OCTET STRING, encapsulates {
001A  4A4:     SEQUENCE {
001E    1:       INTEGER 0
0021  101:       INTEGER    
         :         00 B3 17 E6 31 3C 36 24    ....1<6$

And the same key in PKCS#1 format (again only the first few bytes, the rest of the file is basically the raw key):
0000  4A4: SEQUENCE {
0004    1:   INTEGER 0
0007  101:   INTEGER    
         :     00 B3 17 E6 31 3C 36 24    ....1<6$

This website contains a more detailed explanation of the two formats:
https://tls.mbed.org/kb/cryptography/asn1-key-structures-in-der-and-pem
Java normally generates PKCS#8 format, while OpenSSL supports both formats and can convert between them: https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/pkcs8.html
KeyStore Explorer can also generate, process and convert both formats.
So, if you convert privatekey.pem to PKCS#8 with OpenSSL or KSE, it should look identical to the output of System.out.println(key):
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in privatekey.pem -out privatekey.pkcs8 -nocrypt

From document:

The key will become irreversibly invalidated once the secure lock screen is disabled (reconfigured to None, Swipe or other mode which does not authenticate the user) or when the secure lock screen is forcibly reset (e.g., by a Device Administrator). Additionally, if the key requires that user authentication takes place for every use of the key, it is also irreversibly invalidated once a new fingerprint is enrolled or once no more fingerprints are enrolled, unless setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(boolean) is used to allow validity after enrollment. Attempts to initialize cryptographic operations using such keys will throw KeyPermanentlyInvalidatedException.

"11239501","Which decryption uses a binary public key with variable length?","I have a program which is obviously decrypting its data with a public, binary key of variable length.
I came to these facts by doing some more or less educated guesses:

Reverse Engineering revealed that the program needs the name of a file including a public key
Viewing this file in a hex editor shows totally random binary data (with no interesting pattern or anything), prefixed with the length of the file - in one version the file is only 200 bytes long, in another about 2000 bytes.
Thinking about the security, I guess the programs company encrypts the data files with a private key so that noone can create their own data files (which would fit the programs needs - no ""modding"" should be allowed nor the data be shown in third party programs).
The data files are prefixed with a human readable 64 byte long header, the rest is again completely random binary data.

I'd like to use the same system for my own program, if such thing is available.
Is there an encryption method capable of asymmetric encryption / decryption with a binary key of variable length, if yes, which one and how can I implement such thing?
","That's not the way to proceed. You can use a fixed length key for variable length data. As asymmetric crypto is pretty slow, the usual method is to generate a random symmetric secret key (say, a 128 bit AES key) and encrypt the data using e.g. CBC. Then the symmetric key is encrypted by an asymmetric public key, say RSA 2048 bits. Decryption means decrypting the secret key using the private key, then decrypting the data with the data specific secret key.
If you don't know how to do this you can use a library capable of creating CMS (cryptographic message syntax) to perform this scheme.
Note: a 2000 byte asymmetric key pair would take forever to encrypt something, even if you could create a key pair of that size.

","BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY means your key is pkcs#1 format and not pkcs#8. Reading pkcs#1 keys is not natively supported by Java. You need to use bouncycastle library ( see Read RSA private key of format PKCS1 in JAVA )or use any of these solutions Getting RSA private key from PEM BASE64 Encoded private key file

if your key were pkcs#8, it would have the header BEGIN PRIVATE KEY. In that case, for your code to work correctly you would need additionally decode the key content from base64

To convert a pkcs#1 key to pkcs#8 you can use openssl
  openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in pkcs1.key -out pkcs8.key

No.

And passes the Public key to the sender.

No. It sends its certificate to the client and they then start a secret-key negotiation.

Sender encrypt the message using the Public key

No. It uses a symmetric session key negotiated during the handshake.

Yes.

Server decrypt the message using symmetric encryption

Yes.

","aye I know this question is old but maybe my answer will benefit other people like me who were trying to do something similar and stumbled upon this question. I think I figured it out - I used some of your code and some of the code from PyShallot and it's working for me.
import hashlib
from hashlib import sha1
import rsa
from pyasn1.type import univ, namedtype
from pyasn1.codec.der import encoder
from base64 import b32encode
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

class RSAPublicKey(univ.Sequence):
    componentType = namedtype.NamedTypes(
            namedtype.NamedType('modulus', univ.Integer()),
            namedtype.NamedType('publicExponent', univ.Integer())
            )

pubkey, privkey = rsa.newkeys(1024)
privkey = privkey.save_pkcs1(format='PEM')
key = RSA.importKey(privkey)
n = key.n
e = key.e
public_key = RSAPublicKey()
public_key.setComponentByName('modulus', n)
public_key.setComponentByName('publicExponent', e)
pubkey = encoder.encode(public_key)
onion = b32encode(sha1(pubkey).digest())[:16].lower()+'.onion'
print str(onion)
print str(privkey)

The code above prints an onion address and the corresponding private key. PyShallot seems to work by calculating a public key and private key piece by piece instead of using an RSA library. I used the rsa module to generate a private key and the Crypto module to extract the individual RSA parameters, and then I used the code from PyShallot to calculate the public key. From there I could derive the onion address. It's really ugly and hacky, and there's definitely a better way to do it that's faster and doesn't use so many libraries. But it works.

","Your code basically works. You have an issue with the hexToBase64 function converting ""e"": ""10001"" because the exponent 10001 represented as hexadecimal should be 010001. Note the leading zero.

","To understand this question, its best to know a little about asymmetric encryption. In asymmetric encryption, you have a public key and a private key. Together they make a ""keypair."" The public key is used to encrypt. The private key is then used to decrypt. Note the private key can only decrypt files that were encrypted with the matching public key.
So now we know that there are 2 files needed to make everything work.

Can I just copy my private key from this computer among my other computers to connect to >the servers, or do I have to generate private keys on each computer and then authorize >their public keys on each server?

The answer simply is, yes. You can copy the public or private key to any computer and use it with any OS. As long as you have the public key, you can encrypt messages. If you have the private key, then you can decrypt those files afterwards. Its just a matter of the files being present on the computer.

If not, is there a better way to do it (that would save me some time)?

While theres no technical reason you cant copy and reuse the same keypair everytime, this is not a good practice in terms of security. For example, if you have a forest of 100 servers all sharing the same keypair, if 1 is compromised or hacked, the rest of the 99 servers are also compromised. If you have a unique keypair on each server, then they would need to compromise all 100 servers to get the same effect. The simple act of using a unique keypair everytime increases the amount of work for an attacker by orders of magnitude.

"49968678","Where to store private keys in public/private key encryption in PHP?","I am currently developing an LMS for a school. I want to encrypt the grades students get so that only school administrators, teachers, and the student can access the grades. I don't want to be able to see the grades, and I don't want someone who somehow gets access to the database to see the grades either.
Here's how I'm thinking I'll store the grades in a database, but I'm not 100% sure if this is good or the best it can be.

Every user (teacher, admin, student) has a public and private key
Teacher grades an assignment
The grade gets encrypted with multiple public keys (every teacher and administrator's keys, as well as the student's) and then gets stored in a MySQL database
When a teacher, admin, or the student visits a page to see the grade, the grade gets decrypted with that user's private key.
The private key could be stored in the database, encrypted by the user's password. When a user logs in (with their password), their private key gets decrypted and then stored in a session variable (or cookie) for use during their session to decrypt the grade(s).

One thing that (I think) makes this hard is that there will inevitably be staff changes (a new administrator, a teacher gets replaced, etc.) and I need all teachers and administrators to have access to all grades. So how would I allow a new key pair to access the encrypted data when a new user account should have access?

","This seems to arise when you have repeated unlockings in a short period of time, especially when you enter your passphrase incorrectly a few times. I think this might be a security policy that OpenSSL is enforcing about repeated unlocking of an unchanged certificate. Or maybe it's a cache issue. But marking the file as ""changed"" is enough to reset the (security?) cache:
$ touch /path/to/key.pem

PrivateKey privkey = idPair.getPrivate();

THe following code is for receiving the certificate and exporting it to .cer file.

KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"", ""BC"");

Asides: you don't need that loop to convert a Collection to an array, just one call .toArray (new T[optionally_correct_size]) will do it. On the other hand, since you're only using the first element you don't need an array at all, just Collection<T>.iterator().next(). 
More substantively and on the third hand, many -- but definitely not all -- operations done with the privatekey also need the full cert chain, not just the leaf/end-entity cert, to work correctly. For example some signers can compute a signature without the chain, but in some cases or circumstances that signature cannot be verified and thus will be rejected by whatever receives it. Since you give no clue how, by what and for what your exported file(s) will be used, it is impossible to give any advice on this. And if the full chain is needed, it also varies whether you can just use a sequence of individual/separate PEM certs or need something else. 
I don't know what Base64 encoder you are using; that signature does not match the BouncyCastle one. I hope it generates line breaks correctly. PEM format is NOT merely BEGIN-line, base64, END-line; it is BEGIN-line, base64 with line breaks, END-line. Some software will work, sometimes, even without the line breaks, but some software, sometimes, will fail. See RFC 7468 sec 2 near the end. 

Now, my goal is when I open the exported file, I must be prompted to input password to install/view the certificate. ... But, now, I need to protect the certificate with password. Is this even possible? 

You need to distinguish between the privatekey and the certificate(s). Although related in an important way, these are different things, and the privatekey is designed to be private/secret while the certificate is designed to be public. In particular, the PEM format certificate is not encrypted, so anyone can view it and use it for publickey operations (encrypt or verify) and otherwise do what they like with it.
But to perform a privatekey operation (decrypt or sign) you need the privatekey -- usually linked to a cert or chain as above -- and the privatekey can be password-encrypted in (at least) two different ways in customary PEM formats, thus requiring the password to 'open' it. OpenSSL back in the 1990s de-facto defined a PEM encryption scheme which can be used for its several 'legacy' or 'traditional' privatekey formats, which are different for each algorithm, and indicated in the PEM type in the BEGIN-line, thus -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----, -----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY-----, -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----, etc. Later PKCS8 defined a generic privatekey format for all algorithms, used by much other software including Java crypto (JCA), including an encrypted variant designated by -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- (note no algorithm name). The PKCS8 version (only) has been made official by RFC7468 sec 11. (There are also other and quite different PEM-like formats for privatekeys used by OpenSSH, PuTTY, and PGP, but none of them use X.509-type certificates. Although GnuPG now implements both PGP and S/MIME, and does use X.509/PKIX for S/MIME. There are numerous existing Qs on SO, and some on security.SX or crypto.SX, if you are interested in these.) bcpkix implements the OpenSSL-legacy forms and the PKCS8 form(s). (Java alone without BouncyCastle implements PKCS8 unencrypted.) 
Similarly, 'legacy' Java keystores (JKS and JCEKS) password-encrypt the privatekey(s), but not the certificate(s). The PKCS12 standard is actually very flexible (and complicated), but as usually implemented (including your BC-keystore example) uses strong password encryption for the privatekey(s), and a very weak easily breakable password encryption for the certificate(s); I've never been quite sure why, because this is less convenient without providing any security benefit.

If so, what will be the file extension? 

That's mostly up to you, or whoever (if anyone) these files are for. No standard requires a file extension to match the file contents or vice versa, although people usually do so because it is much more convenient. Officially .cer is supposed to be a DER certificate, and RFC7468 sec 5.3 recommends using .crt for a PEM certificate. If you write the key to a separate file, it seems to be fairly common to use .key or .pem, but I know of no standard (and certainly no IANA registration) specifying this. (RFC5958 registers .p8 for what is actually DER PKCS8 unencrypted and RFC8351 registers DER PKCS8 encrypted without specifying any extension.) If you write the key and cert(s) to the same file, which PEM format supports but not all programs do, I haven't even seen common practice other than .pem. 
So to finally get to your question :-) 
Given you have the BC provider in your provider list (and the classpath), bcpkix in the classpath, and a PrivateKey object in kv:
import org.bouncycastle.openssl.PKCS8Generator;
import org.bouncycastle.openssl.jcajce.JcaPEMWriter;

"56287009","How to export Certificate and private key as a single file using java code?","My requirement is to combine a certificate and private key and then, using PEMwriter, I need to export the file.
I used bouncycastle to generate private key and csr. Then, I submitted the CSR to CA and got the certificate. 
THe following code is for generating keypair
KeyPair idPair = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"").genKeyPair();
PublicKey publicKey = idPair.getPublic();
PrivateKey privkey = idPair.getPrivate();

THe following code is for receiving the certificate and exporting it to .cer file.
CertStore store = response.getCertStore();
            Collection<? extends Certificate> certs = store
                    .getCertificates(null);
            Certificate[] chain = new Certificate[certs.size()];

            int i = 0;
            for (Certificate certificate : certs) {
                chain[i++] = certificate;
            }

            FileOutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(""cert.cer"");
            os.write(""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"".getBytes(""US-ASCII""));
            os.write(Base64.encodeBase64(chain[0].getEncoded(), true));
            os.write(""-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"".getBytes(""US-ASCII""));
            os.close();

Now, my goal is when I open the exported file, I must be prompted to input password to install/view the certificate. I'm really confused about this part. Previously I added password to keystore like the following
KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"", ""BC"");
        keyStore.load(null, null);

        keyStore.setKeyEntry(""mykey"", (Key) keyPair.getPrivate(), ""Password1!"".toCharArray(), certz);

        ByteArrayOutputStream bout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        keyStore.store(bout, ""Password1!"".toCharArray()); // this is the password to open the .p12

        byte[] keystore = bout.toByteArray();
        bout.close();

But, now, I need to protect the certificate with password. Is this even possible? If so, what will be the file extension? And please guide me in the coding part (PemWriter).
Thanks
","As mentioned above for normal use you don't need to protect certificates with passwords. But if you want to store some certificates in a safe place, you can do it in a password-protected keystore file (only java.security code, no PemWriter necessary). 
            KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS12"");
            ks.load(null, null);

            Certificate cert = getX509Cert(); // load certificate
            ks.setCertificateEntry(""myCertAlias"", cert);

            FileOutputStream fos = null;
            try {
                fos = new FileOutputStream(PATH + ""newKeyStore.p12"");
                char[] password = PASSWORD_.toCharArray();
                ks.store(fos, password);
            } finally {
                if (fos != null) {
                    fos.close();

Thanks all!
","In .NET Core the RSACng object should be in an exportable state when you use ImportParameters, and it should be the case in .NET Framework 4.7.2 as well.
You can put into an exportable state as long as you change the export policy before using the key (by trying to call Export or doing a sign/decrypt/encrypt/verify operation).  For example, this works:
using (RSA rsa1 = new RSACng(2048))
using (RSACng rsa2 = new RSACng())
{
    rsa2.ImportParameters(rsa1.ExportParameters(true));

    rsa2.Key.SetProperty(
        new CngProperty(
            ""Export Policy"",
            BitConverter.GetBytes((int)CngExportPolicies.AllowPlaintextExport),
            CngPropertyOptions.Persist));

    RSAParameters params2 = rsa2.ExportParameters(true);
    Console.WriteLine(params2.D.Length);
}

Based on the integration ,they are authenticating with signature and payload.
As per document , i did everything right for my point of view,but i got response like


SignatureDoesNotMatch
  
  The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided.
  
  

As per document:
Calculating the Signature:
Requests, where necessary, must be signed by the sender. The signature of a request is calculated as follows:

Condense the payload XML into a single line as follows:
2.Remove the XML declaration
3.Remove all comments
4.Remove all line breaks
5.Normalise spaces

6)Generate an SHA1 digest of the condensed payload .
7)Base16 encode the generated SHA1 digest.
8)Encrypt the encoded digest using a Perfios-provided RSA Private Key .
9)Base16 encode the encrypted digest.
Here my script:
$condense_payload ='<payload><vendorId>test</vendorId><txnId>dummyApplicationId</txnId><emailId>'.$emailid.'</emailId><destination>netbankingFetch</destination><returnUrl>https://www.google.com</returnUrl></payload>';


$condense_payload_updated = trim(preg_replace('/(?<=\>)(\r?\n)|(\r?\n)(?=\<\/)/', $condense_payload));


$payload ='
<payload>
<vendorId>test</vendorId>
<txnId>dummyApplicationId</txnId>
<emailId>'.$emailid.'</emailId>
<destination>netbankingFetch</destination>
<returnUrl>https://www.google.com</returnUrl>
</payload>';

/* Convert to Sha1 */
$sha1_convert = sha1($condense_payload_updated);

/* Convert to Hex (base16) */
$first_base16_convert=bin2hex($sha1_convert);


$fp =  fopen(""private_key"", ""r"");

$private_key_string = fread($fp, 8192);

fclose($fp);

/* Convert to private key */
$private_key = openssl_get_privatekey($private_key_string);

$encrypted_private="""";



/* Encrypt digest using key */

openssl_private_encrypt($first_base16_convert, $encrypted_private, $private_key, OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING);
/* Convert to Hex (base16) */
$signature=bin2hex($encrypted_private);

so here generated payload and signature and send the url with post method:
<html>
    <body onload='document.autoform.submit();'>
        <form name='autoform' method='post' action='https://demo.perfios.com/KuberaVault/insights/start'>
            <input type='hidden' name='payload' value='<?php echo $payload; ?>' />
            <input type='hidden' name='signature' value='<?php echo $signature; ?>'/>
    </body>
</html>

So finally i got:

 SignatureDoesNotMatch  The request
  signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided.

","The figure has several errors and some omissions, because it is probably a simplification:

the hash is digitally signed, not encrypted, and the signature is verified, not decrypted. The underlying cryptographic operation is not equivalent.
the signed data should include the certificate and the certification chain
if you use a known format like CMS, pkcs#7 or XMLDsig the hash to sign usually includes also a  reference to the signing certificate and content-type to avoid tampering

To validate a signed document you verify the signature using the public key of the attached certificate but it is mandatory to check that the signing certificate is trusted verifying that the certificate itself or the issuing Certification Authority is present in the client's trustore. 
The signature includes the certification chain because usually the truststore does not contain the intermediate CAs. The certificates of the truststore are exchanged previously
Additionaly the verification process should check that the certificate is not expired and not revoked

Note that the verification process is the same for all digital certificates in a public key infrastructure, not just RSA

Do you have any ideas, how to get the private bytes from certificates?
May be X509Certificate2 is not the best solution for this...
","Use an approrpiate method of these X509Certificate2 extension methods:

GetRSAPrivateKey(X509Certificate2) -- for RSA keys
GetDSAPrivateKey(X509Certificate2) -- for DSA keys
GetECDsaPrivateKey(X509Certificate2) -- for EC keys

Extension method you need to use depends on asymmtric key algorithm.

When I run this code, I get Resource id #4 followed by a nonsense signature. I even tried putting the private key in a file and reading from the file in which there is multiple lines (private key separated at \n ) but no success. I can't generate meaningful JWT signature from the private key. Can anyone help me with this issue?
Thanks,
","I have managed to solve this issue. Below is the updated code that reads the JSON file downloaded from Google and creates an assertion with which one can then get access token from Google:
<?php
//helper function
function base64url_encode($data) { 
return rtrim(strtr(base64_encode($data), '+/', '-_'), '='); 
}

// Read the JSON credential file my-private-key.json download from Google
$private_key_file=""my-private-key.json"";
$json_file = file_get_contents($private_key_file);

$info = json_decode($json_file);
$private_key = $info->{'private_key'};

//{Base64url encoded JSON header}
$jwtHeader = base64url_encode(json_encode(array(
""alg"" => ""RS256"",
""typ"" => ""JWT""
)));

//{Base64url encoded JSON claim set}
$now = time();
$jwtClaim = base64url_encode(json_encode(array(
""iss"" => $info->{'client_email'},
""scope"" => ""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"",
""aud"" => ""https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token"",
""exp"" => $now + 3600,
""iat"" => $now
)));

$data = $jwtHeader.""."".$jwtClaim;

// Signature
$Sig = '';
openssl_sign($data,$Sig,$private_key,'SHA256');
$jwtSign = base64url_encode( $Sig  );


//{Base64url encoded JSON header}.{Base64url encoded JSON claim set}.{Base64url encoded signature}

$jwtAssertion = $data.""."".$jwtSign;
echo ""$jwtAssertion\n"";

You may then test your code by communicating with Google Drive for example:
curl -d 'grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer&assertion=YOUR-JWT-ASSERTION-BUILD-ABOVE' https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token

I can't find any online examples of how to modify the keyspec to digital signature. I realize it should happen on the private key side, but there just aren't any examples out there, at least in using the bouncycastle code, specifically in the c# examples.
I figure one could use the rsaparams like cspparams in native c# code, but i just can't find anything on it.
Any help would be hugely appreciated!

I can't find any online examples of how to modify the keyspec to digital signature. I realize it should happen on the private key side, but there just aren't any examples out there, at least in using the bouncycastle code, specifically in the c# examples.
I figure one could use the rsaparams like cspparams in native c# code, but i just can't find anything on it.
Any help would be hugely appreciated!

So just to add another answer here, i was able to force keyspec=2 AT_SIGNATURE using this snippet. But it's currently experiencing issues with signing. Just wanted to throw it out there for other to potentially lead them in the right direction.

"44743746","Public private key signing/encoding","I'm stuck trying to base64 encode a public private key. It looks like I can encode public and private keys separately with the SwiftyRSA library.
My problem is that I can't put them together the way the API JWT assertion should look (in RS256). I've read through plenty of documentation, but I'm having trouble trying to do the final task of having a base64 encoded variable.
I found the code below to be helpful. Essentially what I want to do is combine the public and private key into a token. This code is for javascript, but I can't seem to find something similar for Swift.
// First, let's try to use the top-level one-off methods.
jwt = new lib.JsonWebTokens();
 // Encode JWT token using 512-bit RSA signing algorithm.
token = jwt.encode( payload, ""HS512"", getPublicKey(), getPrivateKey() );

Would anyone be willing to look at this and tell me the one or two steps I'm missing?
Other details:
This is for the Box api
Thanks in advance!
--------------- EDIT -----------------------------------------------
I was able to implement the SwiftyRSA library. The example code is below. The output gives me a JWT assertion that works with the jwt.io website. However...(please read below code)
        do {
        // the keys
        let publicKey = try PublicKey(pemNamed: ""public_key"")
        let privateKey = try PrivateKey(pemNamed: ""dec_private_key"")

        // signing the base64url string
        let clear = try ClearMessage(string: encodedStuff, using: .utf8)
        let signature = try clear.signed(with: privateKey, digestType: .sha256)
        print(signature.data)

        // making the signature string base64url encoded
        let finalSig = signature.base64String.replacingOccurrences(of: ""/"", with: ""_"")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ""+"", with: ""-"")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ""="", with: """")
        print(""finalSig: "", finalSig)

        // encrypt the signature and make sure it's in base64url
        let dataToEncrypt = try ClearMessage(string: finalSig, using: .utf8)
        let encryptedData = try dataToEncrypt.encrypted(with: publicKey, padding: .PKCS1)
        let finalEncryptedData = encryptedData.base64String.replacingOccurrences(of: ""/"", with: ""_"")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ""+"", with: ""-"")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ""="", with: """")
        print(finalEncryptedData)

        // concatenate assertion
        jwtAssertion = encodedStuff + ""."" + finalEncryptedData
        print(""JWT Assertion: \(jwtAssertion)"")

        // decrypt to see if it works
        let recodedBase64 = base64urlToBase64(base64url: finalEncryptedData)
        let theEncrypted = try EncryptedMessage(base64Encoded: recodedBase64)
        let clearMessage = try theEncrypted.decrypted(with: privateKey, padding: .PKCS1)
        // decode decrypted message
        let finalDecrypted1 = clearMessage.base64String
        let finalDecrypted2 = Data(base64Encoded: finalDecrypted1)
        let finalDecrypted3 = String(data: finalDecrypted2!, encoding: .utf8)
        print(""finalDecrypted3: "", finalDecrypted3 ?? ""no go!"") //this gives you the finalSig (which is decrypted)



    } catch let thisError {
        print(""An error has occurred!"",thisError)
    }

It turns out I have to use base64url for each, which is only a matter of replacing some characters with other, etc. So, everything looks good and still works on the jwt website, but when I send it using the code below I get this error message: 

{""error"":""invalid_grant"",""error_description"":""OpenSSL unable to verify data: error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line""}

I've followed all the steps on how to do this for the Box API, but it's just not working out. I'd really like to know what I'm doing wrong here.

"30638569","Multiple Keystores vs Multiple Keys and export/import of keys","I'm developing multiple Android applications for various clients. I manage the complete lifecycle of development for my clients which includes development and publishing to Google Play.
I'm concerned about how I should sign the applications I make for my clients. Right now, I have 1 keystore, and for each client, I create their own private key. 
My concern is, if one day the clients want to take their Android app and manage it on their own without me, I'll need to give them their private key so that they can publish updates to the app.
My question is, is it possible to do this with only 1 keystore, and somehow export the private key which belongs a certain client from the keystore and give it to them, or should I be creating a keystore for each client? If the former is possible, then how is it technically done?
The scenario which would be ideal for me would be to be able to export a single private key from my keystore into another keystore, and be able to alter the password of this key without it affecting the validity of the key so that it can still be used to update the app it was made for in the future.
","You can import or export your private keys into PKCS#12 (.p12) files using a program called keytool :
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore existing-store.jks -destkeystore new-store.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12

This page lists many things that are possible with the keystore, ie. changing its format, and exporting out single keys :
http://www.startux.de/index.php/java/44-dealing-with-java-keystoresyvComment44
There is also an app called Keystore Explorer which does the same job but using a GUI :
http://keystore-explorer.sourceforge.net/
You can change the password, without affecting signing ability :
keytool -keypasswd -alias ""key name"" -keypass ""old password"" -new ""new password"" -keystore ""keystore path""

This means, when your client wants their key from your keystore, just export it out.

","You can manually extract a certificate from windows store if you have marked as extractable when importing.
The certificate can be saved as p12 using a password. After this you need a third party library to decrypt the p12 file, parse the content and extract the private or public key

But I think there is a security problem .
if we want to use this method,we must put xml files in web root directory and anyone can access these keys...
how can we prevent this problem ? 
","The emphasis of the article is about how to use asymmetric encryption (RSA) and an example in C#.  Key management is, really, another (big) topic.  
On windows, there are key containers where you can save private keys and then set user permissions on who can read/write/modify the key.
You can then administer the import and export of the keys in order to move them between machines.
As you point out, key management is vital to design a secure system.  There are many solutions that vary in complexity and cost.

","SSH Public key is used for accessing the cluster not for creating the cluster.  A cluster is created under an Azure Subscription, anybody share the same Azure subscription can see the cluster.

2.CryptAcquireCertificatePrivateKey(...)
3.CryptGetUserKey(...)
4.CryptExportKey(...)

But the private key I have got, I don't know how to use it. 
","Warning : This is not the exact answer for your question, but i hope it will give you some help towards what you want to acheive
Based on my experience, Windows crypto APIs are designed to use the private key within the certificate store rather than export the key outside, unless you are using CryptoAPI standard functions like PFXExportCertStoreEx ().
CryptExportKey function gives the private/public key pair in a key blob structure which you have to convert to the format you want. The closest thing i have ever seen this being being done is in
Openssl engine for Windows, filename : e_capi.c
refer to the function
 **capi_load_privkey() and subfunction capi_get_pkey()**

Here conversion of the Key blob to OpenSSL compatible structure is done.
Hope this helps

"56594968","Extract private key and certificate from an android application","I'm new to reverse engineering, I've never developed an android application before and I'm trying to extract from an android application the certificate it's using to authenticate to the server.
One of the answers to this post mentions that extracting a private key from an apk file is indeed a possible thing.
This post says that unlesss we have the original keystore file of the application we won't be able to extract the private key. Is it possible to get the original keystore file? Most of the posts seem to agree on the fact that this is impossible!
I've decompiled the application I'm interested in, and I retrieved the CERT.RSA from it, but I don't know if this can help me extract the certificate and the private key from the application. What can we do with the CERT.RSA file anyways?
I know that an android application is accessible to anyone from the google play store, so if what I'm trying to do is possible anyone could extract the certificate and private key and hack any application, but I just want to know if there were some specific tips/hacks, a good tutorial or just an indication of where to start off?
Here is the pcap I get when I send a request to the server that the app communicates with:

10.0.0.1 is the client IP address and 192.168.10.211 is the server's IP address, and we can see that the client is sending 2 certificates to the server during the handshake session, so where do these certificates come from? are they hardcoded in the application?
UPDATE
As you can see on the pcap file, the client does send a certificate to the server during the handshake session, so I spent the last few days trying to retrieve it and use it to forward a request to my server.
I've finally managed to retrieve the certificate, the problem is I don't know how can I use it to get the job done.
Here is exactly what I did:
This is the java code that logs the certificate and the password that the client uses during the handshake protocol:
    public static native byte[] getCplusPKCS12Cert();

    public static native byte[] getCplusPKCS12Pass();

    static {
        System.loadLibrary(""cplusnative"");
    }

    public static SSLSocketFactory a() {
        SSLSocketFactory sSLSocketFactory = null;
        SSLContext instance = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
        byte[] cplusPKCS12Cert = getCplusPKCS12Cert();
        String s = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cplusPKCS12Cert);
        Log.d('certificate',s);
        byte[] cplusPKCS12Pass = getCplusPKCS12Pass();
        Log.d('password',cplusPKCS12Pass);        
        return sSLSocketFactory;
    }

This allows me to get the certificate which is a PKCS12 certificate that's secured with a password which is logged to the terminal too when I launch:$ adb logcat
This is what I get:

password: S0xXYUY4QWtSdW9mYW5VAA==
I put the certificate in a .p12 file, but I can't open it. 
To overcome this issue I print the certificate to android storage: storage/emulated/0/output.p12 which created a file containing hexadecimal data. When I use this file to forward a request to my server using python:
$ python3

> from requests_pkcs12 import get
> r = get(url, pkcs12_filename='theOutput.p12', pkcs12_password='S0xXYUY4QWtSdW9mYW5VAA==')

I get the following error:

Error: [('asn1 encoding routines', 'ASN1_get_object', 'header too long')]

I feel that I have all the pieces of the puzzle and I only need to put them together, so my question is: How can I use the resources (certificate/password) I have retrieved to forward requests to the server?
Thank you.

We have no idea what else we should try to handle this issue.
Any guidelines would be more than welcome

","I think you're not instantiating the client correctly, accordingly with the doc for Named Clients.
You will need to receive the IHttpClientFactory in run-time and ask for your named client like this:
 var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient(""TestClient"");

About testing with Dependency Injection, I believe this Microsoft tutorial can help: Integration Tests Asp.Net Core. The deal here is, as the Startup.cs file and the Core Dependency Injector are part of the framework, you need to setup simulate the web application in the test context. And Microsoft provides the WebApplicationFactory for that. 
This example demonstrate a test with a httpClient given by the IHttpClientFactory in a simulated web application environment.

For any real life applications you will need much larger numbers than you can fit into 64-bit types. There are many ways of doing this but GMP (GNU Multiple Precision lib) has mpz_powm(r, base, exp, mod) that you can use in the decryption phase. More info here.
So basically if you had your cipher text c and your private key defined as n (=p*q) and d then you could decrypt c into plaintext m like this:
#include <gmp.h> // requires GMP lib to be installed.
void rsaDecrypt(const mpz_t c, const mpz_t n, const mpz_t d, mpz_t m) {

","In asymmetric cryptography, using private key to encrypts acts as a signature: every one can verifies that you had signed using your public key but only you can sign using your private key (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#Digital_signatures).

Is it possible to pack said certificate in an android application when the user completes the process of obtaining it and instead of offering him the download of his certificate, offer him to download the application which already contains his certificate?
Or are there any alternative approaches? Perhaps generating the certificate within the application using the private and public key?
","Are you expecting your users to be technically competent and willing to install your app on their own, using ADB?
In my opinion, a better option is to have your (generic) app recognize that it has no certificate and walk the user through retrieving it from your server. This retrieval could entail fetching a previously generated certificate (such as through entering a code you've provided in advance) or generating a new one (either locally or on your remote server, depending on your situation and security requirements). Not only will this work for more users, it will be less to maintain on your end as well.

","Sounds like you're trying to use public / private key pairs when symmetric keys ought to be used.
I'd just generate a random string of 16 bytes and use that.  You can get it from /dev/urandom on Linux.
Public / private key pairs are longer because they have special requirements that regular symmetric algorithm keys don't.  The mudolo of an RSA key pair, for instance, needs to be a multiple of two primes, which excludes a lot of numbers / strings.  eg. 60000 isn't a multiple of just two primes - it's factorization shows that it's a multiple of 5^4 * 2^5 * 3.

","Looks like your broker does plain textbook RSA decryption, not PKCS#1 padded RSA like OpenSSL does by default. Therefore the brokers test application does not remove the padding and you get a padded plaintext block as a result.
You can try to encrypt without any random padding by using OPENSSL_NO_PADDING as optional fourth argument to openssl_private_encrypt:
openssl_private_encrypt($plaintext, $encrypted, $llave_priv, OPENSSL_NO_PADDING);

Note that using unpadded plain textbook RSA is inherently insecure in most circumstances. In general, RSA should be used with a secure random padding mechanism, such as PKCS#1 2.1 OAEP. Otherwise there are a lot of cryptographic security issues, such as the complete interchangeability of decryption and signing, easy attacks against the mathematical structure including malleability, and the lack of semantic security. These may or may not be applicable to your situation, since you seem to essentially use an ad-hoc RSA signature protocol.

","There's generally no way to hide any kind of credentials that (any) application possess from the end user. You can only make them hard to be found, but it's questionable whether it is even worth the effort.
What you can (and should do) is to make sure the credentials grants only as little access as necessary.
So in your case, make sure the account, you authenticate with the private key:

has only write access (no read access, nor even list)
and has a low disk quota
is regularly (or automatically) monitored for any unusual activity


Specifically regarding the private key for WinSCP .NET assembly:
Yes, it has to be stored on the disk (i.e. temporarily extracted to a temp folder). Though you can have the private key encrypted with a passphrase. And have the passphrase hard-coded in the application (obfuscated if your want).
See SessionOptions.SshPrivateKeyPassphrase.

"54168369","InvalidKeySpecException: How do I extract a private key from a .der file?","I have a private key file in the .der format. I'm trying to save this private key as a PrivateKey object (with Java) like this:
PrivateKey clientPrivKey = getPrivateKeyFromKeyFile(""C:\\Users\\Bob\\Desktop\\Assignments\\Project\\VPN Project\\src\\client-private.der"");

This is what the getPrivateKeyFromKeyFile method looks like:
private static PrivateKey getPrivateKeyFromKeyFile(String keyfile) throws Exception
    {
        Path path = Paths.get(keyfile);
        byte[] privKeyByteArray = Files.readAllBytes(path);

        PrivateKey myPrivKey = keyFactory.generatePrivate(keySpec); 
        return myPrivKey;
    }

But when I try this, I keep getting InvalidKeySpecException because of this line of code:
PrivateKey myPrivKey = keyFactory.generatePrivate(keySpec);

I'm not sure what's the issue here. I opened up the private key file and everything looks fine. It starts with -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and ends with -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----.
And in case it's relevant, I created this private key using this OpenSSL command:
genrsa -out client-private.der 2048

","A file generated with
openssl genrsa -out <path to output-file> 2048

is actually not a .der-file, but a .pem-file (see e.g. What are the differences between .pem, .cer and .der?) and the data are not stored in the PKCS8-format, but in the PKCS1-format (see e.g. PKCS#1 and PKCS#8 format for RSA private key).
Keys in the PKCS1-format can not be processed directly using standard Java tools. For this, third-party libraries like BouncyCastle are necessary (see e.g. Read RSA private key of format PKCS1 in JAVA).
Another possibility is to convert the PKCS1-formatted key into a PKCS8-formatted key with OpenSSL first (see e.g. Load a RSA private key in Java (algid parse error, not a sequence)):
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in <path to the input-pkcs1-pem-file> -out <path to the output-pkcs8-pem-file> -nocrypt

And then, after (programmatic) deletion of the Beginn-/End-line and after base64-decoding the private key can be generated (see e.g. How to read .pem file to get private and public key) e.g. with
private static PrivateKey getPrivateKeyFromKeyFile(String keyfile) throws Exception
{
    Path path = Paths.get(keyfile);
    byte[] privKeyByteArray = Files.readAllBytes(path);

"54183329","Openssl cant extract private key from pkcs12 keystore in fips mode","I have inherited some PKI scripts during the process of our upgrading from RHEL6 to RHEL7 and we seem to be having some issues with OpenSSL and Java's Keytool. I am by no means a PKI expert and have begun to scratch the surface of PKI from researching this issue.
We generate a JKS using keytools genkeypair 
keytool -genkeypair -alias $ALIAS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore $keystore.jks -storepass $pass -keypass $pass -dname ""{$dname}"" -ext san=${san}

and then convert that JKS into a PKCS12 keystore.
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore $keystore.jks -destkeystore $p12keystore -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass $pass -deststorepass $pass -srcalias $ALIAS destalias $ALIAS -srckeypass $pass -destkeypass $pass -noprompt

We then try to extract the private key and store it in a PEM file.
openssl pkcs12 -in $p12keystore -nocerts -out $key.pem  -passin $pass -passout $pass -nomacver

The operation succeeds without issue when we have FIPS disabled on the system. When we enable FIPS, we receive an error
error:060740A0:digital envelope routines:EVP_PBE_CipherInit:unknown cipher: evp_pbe.c:181

doing some digging i find that our keytool doesn't change how it structures the PKCS12 keystore when fips is enabled and I think that this is causing the issue. when i inspect the keystore using openssl I get a similar error after it shows the PCKS7 data inside the keystore
PKCS7 Encrypted data: pbeWithSHA1And40BitRC2-CBC, Iteration 50000
Error outputing keys and certificates
error:060740A0:digital envelope routines:EVP_PBE_CipherInit:unknown cipher: evp_pbe.c:181

I believe that this algorithm is not FIPS compliant which is causing OpenSSL to error out since in fips mode, it disables this cipher and it cant interpret the certificate therefore it cant get into the private key to extract it.
I have a feeling I'm either using a non-Fips compliant version of java (openjdk 1.8.0._171-b19) or I am missing some crypto extension that i would need to make my java FIPS compliant in RHEL7.
I came across some of the previous issues that say to use -descert option as a workaround to use 3DES to get the key but that didn't change the outcome. Any ideas or similar issues you may have encountered?

In RSA we do have (e,n) as public key, (d,n) as private key. I am using phpseclib RSA implementation, there's option for us to get public key in RAW format, but there's none for private key. I came to know from documentation that phpseclib's RSA pads & then encrypts (Which I do not want, as application is purely a mathematical).
Solution for me would be to get either of following two
(a) Get Private Key in Raw Format.
(b) Use some other implementation of RSA which gives me RAW values of both Private Key & Public Key or if there's none implement my own RSA algorithm.
I did go through documentation of phpseclib, no useful solution was found. My question may not be properly formatted, but any help in this matter is welcome. Thanks in advance...

","Here is the solution.
Basically, I need to do ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_private_key

It seems it didn't know how to use the private key id_rsa_kenpeter.

no, it does not know if you will not tell it how to use it, since it does not have standard name.

I have lots of public/private key and a config file in .ssh. Bitbucket is working fine. How do I resolve for github?

Yes, your ~/.ssh/config is a key to this question. Same way as you specified your key to the ssh command, you can do it in the configuration:
Hostname github.com
  IdentityFile id_rsa_kenpeter

You will also probably have to use a full path to that file, since you plan to use a git from different directories than the one where is the key file.

    Cipher pbeCipher = Cipher.getInstance(MYPBEALG);

    // Initialize PBE Cipher with key and parameters
    pbeCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, pbeKey, pbeParamSpec);

    // Encrypt the encoded Private Key with the PBE key
    byte[] ciphertext = pbeCipher.doFinal(plaintext);

    // Now construct  PKCS #8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo object
    AlgorithmParameters algparms = AlgorithmParameters.getInstance(MYPBEALG);

    // and here we have it! a DER encoded PKCS#8 encrypted key!
    return encinfo.getEncoded();

The key is predetermined (so for instance I may decide I want the key to be abc1234)
I am programming in Java and need the algorithm to be a quick as possible as the clients are most likely to be mobile devices. I don't need any compression but I would prefer if the encrypted string wasn't larger.
I am not looking for top-notch encryption here obviously, but it is my understanding that any key based encryption can't be broken without knowledge of the private key anyway.
Can anyone recommend me an algorithm/method for encryption/decryption with a shared private key?
","it is my understanding that any key based encryption can't be broken without knowledge of the private key anyway
That's not even close to true. A lousy algorithm absolutely can be broken without knowledge of the private key.
Anyhow, if there's a shared key, consider AES.
And read up on the JCE/JCA as Java can do AES and other types of encryption out of the box.  Much better than rolling your own.

","First a little bit of clarification:
In Public-key cryptography the public key is used to encrypt the data and the private key is used (by the server) to decrypt the data.
The owner of the private key stores private key and only shares a public key.
Any certificate from a server should contain only a public key.
(It would be a big security issue if the certificate contains the private Key. You could decrypt the messages from any other user)
To check if the cerificate has a private key you can use the HasPrivateKey-Property
cert.HasPrivateKey;

And to get a certificate with only the public key you can use:
byte[] bytes = cert.Export(X509ContentType.Cert);
var publicCert = new X509Certificate2(bytes);

If I receive a Certificate from the server, wouldn't it contain both public and private keys?!

No, not necessarily.
There are two different ways of obtaining the certificate 

PKCS#7/PEM - the file usually contains only the public part of the certificate
PKCS#12/PFX - the store contains certificates with private keys


Is it possbile to remove the private key from the certificate?

By exporting it to a format that lets you store only the public part of the certificate. 
Open a web browser, navigate to any site that uses SSL.
Now click the lock icon and, from there, the certificate information. What you have at the client side (in the browser) is the certificate without the private key. You can save it and even import into the system cert store but still without the private key.

and how can I understand if the certificate has the private key?

If you load it with your C# code, accessing the HasPrivateKey property will be true only for certs with private keys available.

Never, ever place you Keyring for signing playstore apks in your app.
Because everyone can extract the keyring from your app and use it.
Best practice is to create a new keypair inside of your app on first start. So every installation of your app has its own keypair. Otherwise your users could encrypt data from other installations, too.
More secure is it, to ask the user for password. Which you can then use to secure the keystore for the newly generated keypair. This way also a stolen keystore of your app is harder to crack, because it has a password which only your user knows.
Very complex scenarios uses a key exchange system, where your user keys are generated and managed by a server application. Transport can be done with AES encryption etc.

I so not want to stored the public and private key of users in database or in local storage.
","David from Virgil here. Thanks for the question and sorry for making you puzzled.
I believe the issue is: while the sample app generated user private & public keys both for Alice and Bob, published the public keys to our Cards service, it hasn’t saved the private keys anywhere. So, the private keys remained in the browser's local storage and as such, didn’t sync to other browsers/devices where your users have logged in next. So in lack of their private keys, your users weren’t able to decrypt their messages... This is a limitation of the sample app and we should fix that ASAP (task created).
In order to get the app working, I.e. make your users be able to log in from another browser and decrypt messages, they need to retrieve their respected private keys from a central location. Now, it'd be too lame for me to recommend to just save the user private keys to your database (and enable others to access it + decrypt your users' messages), so we created a technology called BrainKey to encrypt the user private key with a key that we derive from the user’s password. Similar approach how Apple uses your TouchID-derived key to encrypt your keychain.
This is what you need to do to make it work:

During user signup (on the client device), generate a private key for your user and publish the public key to our Cards service.
Then use the user's password to generate a BrainKey (which technically is a private key).
Generate the public key from the BrainKey and encrypt the user's previously (Step 1) generated private key.
Now, save this encrypted private key to your database for the user.

Every single time your user logs in with her password, re-generate the same BrainKey from her password, download the encrypted private key from your DB, decrypt it with the BrainKey and now you can use this key to decrypt all chat messages that were sent to her.
Here’s a reference and sample code for our BrainKey tech: https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/javascript/use-cases/v1/brainkey

I so not want to stored the public and private key of users in database or in local storage.
","I'm Dim from Virgil. Let me help you with this use-case.
I prepared some additional information:
Steps #1 and #2 from Virgil Simple JS Demo (You’ve already seen it)
Step #1. User Registration Step.
users register their Public Keys
At this step:

You authenticate Alice
After you successfully authenticated Alice, you give her a JWT to grant her access to Virgil’s Cloud APIs
Alice generates her Private Key (2) -> stores her Private Key into Local Storage -> creates her Virgil Card
Alice Publishes (3) her Virgil Card on Virgil Cards Service (She uses her JWT to do it).
Then you authenticate Bob (User B): same story as Alice.

At the end, Alice and Bob have their own Private Keys and Virgil Cards (Public Key published into our cloud for users to find each other’s Public Keys). 
Step #2. Simple Communication (chat).
Simple e2e encrypted communication
At this step:

Alice looks for & finds Bob’s Public Key at Virgil Cards Service (1)
Alice loads her Private Key from her Local Storage in a browser
Alice signs (with her Private Key) and encrypts (with Bob’s Public Key) a message and sends to Bob through your Application Server
Bob receives the encrypted and signed message
Bob goes to Cards Service to find Alice’s Public Key in order to verify her signature
Bob loads his Private Key from his Local Storage and decrypts the message

As a result, Bob verified Alice’s signature and decrypted the Message from Alice.
And now, comes the problem: Alice decided to use another Browser (or a Device B), but she can’t encrypt Bob’s previous messages on the new device.
Solution: you should transmit her Previous Private Key from Device A to Device B. To do this in the most secure way:

is to encrypt Private Key on a device A with some Additional Secret Key.
transmit encrypted Private Key to Device B. 
use the same Additional Secret Key on Device B to decrypt the encrypted Private Key from Device A.

So, as you see you must use some special Additional Secret Key on both devices (some messengers do this with a QR code between the devices) to do it securely. To do it simpler though, we have a special tech for you to you generate the “Additional Secret Key” that will be the same on both devices. We call that Secret Key - a Brain Key. Brain Key - a strong cryptographic asymmetric key based on Alice’s PASSWORD. 
You can find more information about this key here: https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/docs/java/use-cases/v1/brainkey
So now, let’s take a look at the next step.
Step #3. Store your Private Key in the Cloud
store somewhere encrypted Private Key
At this step:

Alice enters her Password
Alice generates a Brain Key from her password (1)
Alice encrypts her Private Key with the Brain Key (2)
Alice uploads her encrypted private key somewhere in Cloud (to your app’s backend/database)  

As a result, Alice will have her encrypted Private Key in the cloud, that she used to chat with Bob.
Step #4. Alice now uses her new Browser (or new Device)
transmit a Private Key
At this step:

Alice enters her Password (the same that she used previously for Brain Key generation).
This generates her Brain Key (1)
Alice downloads her encrypted Private Key from the Cloud / from your backend/database (2)
Alice decrypts the encrypted Private Key with the Brain Key

As a result, Alice will get her Private Key on a Device B, that she used to chat with Bob on a Device A. This way, the chat conversation survived her device change.
Every time when Alice uses a new device, she can re-generate the same Brain Key and easily get her Private Key, the key that she uses on all her devices to chat with Bob.

How to encrypt a JS generated RSA private key with a passphrase?

You have one of two choices. First, encrypt the entire key beofre it reaches disk. Then decrypt it before you use it. In this case, you treat the key like a file you want to encrypt.
Second, use PKCS #8, a.k.a. RFC 5208, Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #8: Private-Key Information Syntax Specification Version 1.2. In particular, see section 6 of RFC 5208, EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo.
You have a third option, but its not advised. The third option is to use an encrypted PEM encoding. Its not advisable because its been superseded by PKCS #8.
In the future, you will have a fourth option, and that is to use WebCrypto to store your key. In this case, you moved the problem of secure storage to the platform.
Unfortunately, I don't know about the library you are using, so I don't know what it may (or may not offer). But the answers above cover the OpenSSL bits of your question.

"13749677","How to fully encrypt data in Ruby using Private Key encryption?","First, some info on our system, which is basically an eTendering solution for the construction industry.
So:

List item
Our system has multiple companies
Each company has multiple users
Each company can create multiple auctions
Other companies can then submit their bids for the available auctions. A bid consists of hundreds or thousands of individual items, and we would just need to encrypt the 'price' section of these records.

The problem that we're facing is that our large customers do not want us to ever have access to the bid prices, at least while the bidding is in progress, which is totally understandable. Right now, we are simply encrypting the prices via a symmetric encryption, so even though the prices are effectively encrypted in the database, their concern is that we have the key to decrypt the prices.
We're thus looking at some form of public key encryption system.
Here is our initial thoughts on the solution:

When a company signs up, we create a public/private keypair using OpenSSL for it and we save it in S3 or straight into the database. For this to be really useful, we would enforce the user to use a strong password for the private key, which would of course not be saved in the database.
When a company submits a bid for an auction, we encrypt the prices using the public key of the auction's owner company and we save them into the database.
When the auction bidding period is over and the issuing company wants to generate the report the first time, we ask him to input his password and use that along with his company's private key to decrypt the prices.
To make subsequent traffic faster, we cache the decrypted data (and maybe encrypt it using a simple symetrical encryption system)

So here are the questions (and we're unfortunately not security experts, so sorry if those are stupid questions):

Does this make any sense or is it a totally ludicrous or overkill solution?
Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?
What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key? Would there be no other way but to decrypt/re-encode everything with the new key?
What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?
Are there any better solutions that you could recommend?

","To be clear: I have a hunch that your clients are probably not willing to sacrifice all of the conveniences that come with having your system manage some of the cryptography; you should probably present several options and their weaknesses vs convenience.
General Points
Before anything else, you start start with an explicit threat model, covering every possible attack you can think of.  Even if you choose not to address some of the attacks (it's unrealistic to handle everything), you'll ferret out the more obvious attacks, and have at least a basic set of steps for handling others should they occur.
Re: Does this make any sense?
I think the general premise, while overkill on the part of your customers, makes sense from a security perspective.  Your clients want a cryptographically secure system; fair enough.
However, some points on your proposed solution:

By allowing the client to pass their password over the wire, an attacker (which your client seems to think could be you) needs to only man in the middle that password to gain access to the pricing data.

SSL helps mitigate this, but an errant log line somewhere along the line could very well expose the client's password by accident.


The only truly cryptographically secure way (as I see it) for the client to ensure that you don't have access to the pricing data is for them to encrypt it, and your system just acts as a broker for the encrypted data.  This, in effect, makes you a broker of encrypted packets and public keys, but your system should never see private keys.
The question is: are clients willing to manage their own keys, or is that too burdensome to them?  You might be able to automate most of it, at least (client app/website would handle storing the private key locally, and would also be responsible for gathering public keys of the other interested parties in order to decrypt their encrypted bids)
Re: Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP, or another solution?
Really doesn't matter all that much; each of those options just define the container format for the public/private keys and any metadata.  Use whichever one fits your language/platform best.
The main decision point should be in which encryption algorithm and key strength: RSA-2048?  RSA-4096?  elliptic curve?  something else?
Specific to Ruby: You're probably just going to want to use the OpenSSL library, since it's part of the standard library.  But to reiterate my point above: It's even better if your servers never even see the private keys (if the clients are ok with the trade off of better security over convenience)
Re: What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key?
Changing a password is trivial: the private key its self is just encrypted w/ some symmetric algorithm.  Changing the password involves decrypting the existing key, and re-encrypting it with the new key.  If the client were to lose their password, there is no recovery.
Generating a new key is probably safer, but requires more diligence on your part (encrypted payloads will need to identify which key they match, and clients could have multiple keys active at a time).  This is a good thing, though; it is a common practice to rotate keys regularly, even if they are not compromised.

List item
Our system has multiple companies
Each company has multiple users
Each company can create multiple auctions
Other companies can then submit their bids for the available auctions. A bid consists of hundreds or thousands of individual items, and we would just need to encrypt the 'price' section of these records.

The problem that we're facing is that our large customers do not want us to ever have access to the bid prices, at least while the bidding is in progress, which is totally understandable. Right now, we are simply encrypting the prices via a symmetric encryption, so even though the prices are effectively encrypted in the database, their concern is that we have the key to decrypt the prices.
We're thus looking at some form of public key encryption system.
Here is our initial thoughts on the solution:

When a company signs up, we create a public/private keypair using OpenSSL for it and we save it in S3 or straight into the database. For this to be really useful, we would enforce the user to use a strong password for the private key, which would of course not be saved in the database.
When a company submits a bid for an auction, we encrypt the prices using the public key of the auction's owner company and we save them into the database.
When the auction bidding period is over and the issuing company wants to generate the report the first time, we ask him to input his password and use that along with his company's private key to decrypt the prices.
To make subsequent traffic faster, we cache the decrypted data (and maybe encrypt it using a simple symetrical encryption system)

So here are the questions (and we're unfortunately not security experts, so sorry if those are stupid questions):

Does this make any sense or is it a totally ludicrous or overkill solution?
Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?
What happens if a user wants to change his password or generate a new key? Would there be no other way but to decrypt/re-encode everything with the new key?
What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?
Are there any better solutions that you could recommend?

When a company signs up, we create a public/private keypair using OpenSSL for it and we save it in S3 or straight into the database. For this to be really useful, we would enforce the user to use a strong password for the private key, which would of course not be saved in the database.

I am a bit sceptical about this step. If you (the developer company) generate both the public and the private key used for the encryption it means you are 50% into being able to break the encryption. The only thing that protects your customer is the password, which you might be able to bruteforce (i am not suggesting that you will but you have the ability to do so)
If you will use PKI (or what you have described) you need to ensure that the key creation does not happen on your system. The client should create the pair on their systems and then provide you with their publoic key which you will use to encrypt the prices. The client then will be able to decrypt using the private key on which they have sole control

What would some of the pitfalls be with this solution?

The pitfall is that you are making a complex solution. Especially if you follow my advice above, then you place your trust on the customer to not ""lose"" the private key (and/or password) or else they won't be able to decrypt the prices. In addition, if the key leaks from their side, it's difficult to prove that your application is ""innocent""

Would we generate the keys using OpenSSL, OpenPGP or another solution?

In order to prevent the pitfall of a customer losing a key, you might want to look into PGP (the commercial version does this for sure) and into the concept of ADK (additional decryption key) and ""split keys"". The idea is that besides encrypting with the public key of the customer you also encrypt with a ""corporate"" key which can only be used if y out of x number of people come together (as an example, 10 people can possess parts of the key and if 6 of them come together they can reconstruct the key). The parts can be shared amongst your company, the client, their lawyer, etc

","So here's my suggestion, if you want to solve this using encryption...

Each user and each company should generate OpenPGP (or GnuPG) asymmetric public/private key pairs
Each of those public keys should be uploaded to a public key server
Companies could optionally ""sign"" the public keys of the individual users, to designate a trust relationship with those users (and revoke that signature if that relationship changes)
The auctioneer or non-partisan arbiter would also generate a key pair and push that public key to the public key server
As part of an auction registration process, each user would import the public key of the auctioneer, and the auctioneer would import the public key of each user
A trusted third party, perhaps a SaaS vendor outside of the auctioneer, would host a service through which users and the auctioneer would communicate
Bidding users would create a bid by


signing their bid with their private key
encrypting their proposed price to two keys: their own public key and the auctioneer's public key
submitting their bid to the trusted third party service, which would need to enforce an embargo on any user retrieving bids before the auction expiration

At auction end, and only after auction end, the auctioneer retrieves all of the bids, decrypts them, and verifies signatures

A couple of key points:

It's essential that no user or company private keys are ever shared or stored within the service -- that's the only real ""flaw"" I see in your proposed methodology in your question.  If that's the case, it would be very possible for one user to accuse an administrator of ""fraud"" or ""tampering"" with bids, as an administrator of your server would ultimately have access to the private keys of all users, since you've generated them yourself.
Along those same lines, it's essential that any an all communication and ""bids"" are cryptographically ""signed"" with the truly private keys by each user.  This is how you would know that a bid came from one particular user and only that user, and that the bid could not have been tampered with.
Encrypting the bids to the public keys of the bidding user and the auctioneer ensures that the third party SaaS vendor has no introspection into the bids themselves during the blackout period while the auction is open.  I believe this is the most important point to solving your problem as described.
Note that it might actually be preferred to encrypt each bid to a ring of all of the bidding users, if by design you want to make all bids public after the auction is closed.  That would be a slight modification to my algorithm as described above.

In the interest of full disclosure and perhaps some subtle marketing, I happen to be the architect and CTO of a company called Gazzang who has implemented a product called zTrustee which operates exactly as described above ;-)

"40660426","How to stop Windows CryptoAPI to add private key to public-only cert upon decryption","I'm trying to test S/MIME decryption but CryptDecryptMessage function in decryption mode keeps working even if the certificate in Personal store is public-only (while private key is needed for decryption). Magically, the certificate turns into private+public certificate after this function is called.
Initially, I had full certificate in my Personal store and everything was working fine. Then, I had to test what would happen if someone tried to decrypt having just a public-key cert. So I exported public key, removed cert from the store and imported the public key alone. But I can't do my testing that because Windows somehow adds the private key back to the cert. Perhaps, there is some internal cache of private keys or something like that which is activated when CryptoAPI needs the private key. I would like to disable this feature if possible or somehow tell the system that I don't want to use it with my CryptoAPI calls.
The same occurs with Outlook (as it internally uses the same CryptoAPI functions).
I now added the excerpt from sources (cannot create the fully self-contained sample as it turns out to be too complex) but the decryption part should be OK. I double checked that the private key appears in the certificate at the very moment when CryptDecryptMessage is executed, not before or after.

You can read about it in Kubernetes docs here.
It’s hard to say by the names of your certs what are they used for.
You should refer to the standard configuration.
Besides, you can have a look at kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way as he’s showing how and when to use certificates.
You can check this comment posted on Github regarding what kind of certifications are needed between which services.

","yes it is possible ...
but you have to handle all the stuff about the way how the key is represented, i.e. how the specific parts of the key are stored in a file, etc
your private key consists of some numbers, usually like this:
d (private exponent), N (common modulus) P,Q (two very large primes) dP and dQ (intermediate values for a computational shortcut ... ignore them for your task)
what you want to do is to calculate PHI = (P-1)*(Q-1) and then run the extended euclidean algorithm (see wikipedia for that) for d and PHI to find the multiplicative inverse element of d mod PHI ... this element is e (public exponent)
your public key then is the tuple (e, N)

","Enable SSH agent forwarding
Since you're using key-based authentication, the best solution is to allow
forwarding of the authentication agent connection over the secure channel.
If your public key is stored on the last server, there’s no need to store your
corresponding private key on the intermediate host.
Since the default client setting is not to forward the authentication
agent to the remote host, you should enable agent forwarding in your client
configuration. Add the following line to your ~/.ssh/config:
Host intermediate.server.name
    ForwardAgent yes

On the server, the default is to enable Agent Forwarding but in case it has
been disabled, you should ensure that the following line is uncommented in the
server’s SSHD configuration (usually /etc/sshd_config).
AllowAgentForwarding yes

GitHub have a good article on Using SSH agent forwarding which references Steve Friedl's comprehensive Guide to SSH Agent Forwarding.

","RSA key pairs have to be generated randomly. 
Making the generation deterministically - you no longer generate a key but derive the key from certain data (e.g. based on a MAC address). This reduces the security of the generated keys to zero - hence they are useless and you don't even have to start to generate them.
The central assumption the security of RSA bases on is that the private key is only known to the key owner. If you take a public information like the MAC address the following formula applies:
RSA key pair = your-derivation-algorithm( MAC address )
If you want to know the RSA private key (which is part of the key pair) you need the MAC address and the derivation-algorithm. The MAC is public and the derivation-algorithm will be public earlier or later.
Hence the RSA private key is public too, which makes it useless from a security perspective because everybody who knows the MAC address can generate it.
Keep in mind: Security bases on secret data in combination with a well-engineered algorithm. Whether the algorithm is public or not should not have any effect on the security. If it has an effect you have an insecure algorithm you can throw away.

Given that in this example my credential type is ""Username with password"" I have to use usernamePassword(...).  If my credential type was ""SSH Username with private key"" I would use sshUserPrivateKey(...).
usernameVariable sets the name of a new environment variable for the username.
passwordVariable sets the name of a new environment variable for the password.
You can then access and make use of the username and password values from the credential using the environment variables ${p_username} and ${p_password}.

I have setup the community version (V4). I have 2 web servers with replicated content, I have a virtual IP setup in the system which points to the 2 IP addresses of the web servers. The load balancer works for HTTP and HTTPS traffic correctly but shows an cert error when trying to get to the servers via HTTPS.
I want to combat this by adding a certificate to the load balancer. To do this I have followed the these steps:
https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/manage-certificates-with-zen-load-balancer/ (ignoring the bit about purchasing a cert from SofIntel as we use JISC for our Certs)
Basically I created a certificate in the load balancer, generated the CSR, purchased a certificate from JISC by uploading the CSR generated from the load balancer. 
I then downloaded the ZIP file from JISC which contains the crt for the domain, as well as the root certificates required also in the ZIP.
I tried uploading the ZIP to the load balancer and it pops up an error showing that the certificate needs to be created in a PEM format.
I then found this here:
https://www.zevenet.com/knowledge-base/howtos/create-certificates-pem-format/
I am not really sure what this is asking me to do....does this mean the original CSR that I generated is irrelevant now? The instructions on the above link say that the PEM file needs to be the following:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- Private Key (without passphrase) -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Certificate (CN=www.mydomain.com) -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Intermediate (Intermediate CA, if exists) -----END CERTIFICATE----- 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- Root (ROOT CA, who signs the Certificate) -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Essentially I already have the domain certificate, the intermediate and the root all from JISC now. But is there any way  can go about getting the Private key from the load balancer so that I can just create the PEM file manually.
I am pretty new to cert stuff, not sure why it wont just let me upload the zip file.

"46012756","How to store Encryption Keys while in use","I am making a social media type website, and I store user details such as emails, names and other personal details.
I will be encrypting the personal details using an Encrypt-then-MAC concept. When the user registers, a cryptographically secure string will be made to use as the private encryption key. When the user selects a password, the encryption key will be encrypted using the password.
The password will NOT be stored in the database, but will be the private key to decrypt the encryption key used to encrypt the personal details. The only person who knows the password is the user. My question is: how can I store the encryption key once decrypted?
I have thought of having a table with one column for IP and another column for the encryption key, but some people close the browser window without logging out, therefore there would not a possible way to remove the entry from the database when they have finished their session on the website.
Another way would be to store it in a cookie, but that could be intercepted when sent back to the server. I would like to know if there is a secure, nearly foolproof way to store the encryption key, client side or server side.
Thanks in advance.
EDIT:
In reply to TheGreatContini's answer - 
The idea of a ""zero-knowledge web application"" (in your blog) is a good one, however, for zero-knowledge, even the key cannot be stored in the database, this complicates things a bit, as you would then have to use the user's password as the key. Using the password isn't as secure, as it is a bit harder to verify the password to prevent data which has been ""decypted with the wrong key"" from passing. There is the concept of Encrypt-then-MAC but that only verifies if the data is legit, and will assume that a hacker has messed with some data and data cannot be trusted, however, as you cannot actually verify the password (the hash would not be stored as it is ""zero-knowledge""), so the password may just be wrong.
","Not sure I have the answer, but a few considerations:
(1) Sessions need to be timed out.  Perhaps you can do this by periodically running batch jobs that scan the database looking for sessions that have lacked activity.  This requires storing in the db the date of the last action from the user.
(2) Generally keys are higher value than the content they protect because the keys have a longer lifetime than the individual data elements that the protect (because the data may change or additional data may be added).  Rather than storing the key in the db, you can store the decrypted contents in the database for the length of the session.  Of course, this is provided that you did (1).
Perhaps I am not adding much beyond what you already know, however may be worth considering a blog I wrote exactly about this topic.  The low level details start in the section ""A second line of defence for all the sensitive data.""  Prior to that it mainly motivates the concept.  Glad to see somebody actually doing something like this.

","You're trying to perform a series of transformations, but you're not doing the opposite thing in each direction.
You've taken the encrypted binary data and converted it to base64, but then you're taking the base64 data and converting it back to binary using UTF-8, after splitting it by commas for some reason:
var dataArray = data.Split(new char[] { ',' });
byte[] dataByte = new byte[dataArray.Length];
dataByte = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

To reverse the last operation of the base64-encoding, you should be performing a base64-decoding:
byte[] dataByte = Convert.FromBase64String(data);

I've seen some notes that imply that I must have a ""PKCS#1"" format, instead of ""PKSC#8"" and talk about calling ""openssl"" to convert the file.  I'd really rather not do that.  Is there a straightforward way to do this conversion (assuming this is what I need) in Java?  I intend this code to execute only once at application startup.
Update:
Ok, after considering the alternatives, I used openssl to convert the file to PKCS#8 format.  After that, I was able to complete the construction of the Client object, but I get another error while trying to make a connection.  I considered it possible that this is a related but different problem (and I wanted to reduce the number of ""Updates"" on a single posting), so I posted that as a separate question at CXF REST client call with 2-way auth failing with "unable to find valid certification path to requested target" .
Also note that I've converted the key file from PKCS#1 to PKCS#8, but I never did anything with the cert file.
In the meantime, I could use a little more background on PKCS#1 vs. PKCS#8.  How ""legacy"" is PKCS#1?  I note that the original name of the key file that was given to me used an acronym representing the previous name of our organization, which changed several years ago.

Thank you
","You seem to be misunderstanding the purpose of the 2^160 bit range.
Each standard bitcoin address is tied to the HASH160 of the public key. A HASH160 is 160 bits long, which is why your search space is 2^160. If you are able to find two private keys for which the HASH160 of the public keys are equal, any of those two private keys can spend coins sent to that address.
Searching a smaller space does not make sense since you are no longer searching for bitcoin addresses. If you just want to search random hash functions, then you simply need to replace RIPEMD160 hash function with another one that has an output in whatever bitsize you wish to search.
Note that if you do that, the rest of the code talking about checking balances etc. will be of no use, since your output will no longer be a bitcoin address.

"50560535","Adding private key to certificate with only public key on Windows Server in .NET","The following lines of code, which is part of a .NET FW 4.6.2 Console Application, execute without exceptions when run on a Windows 10. But when running on a Windows Server 2016 it causes a CryptographicException to be thrown when the Export method is called, saying Keyset does not exist (even when running as Administrator). (If compiling code for .NET Core 2, it compiles, but the executable throws a PlatformNotSupportedException on the first row.)
Certificate.PrivateKey = RSA;
byte[] Bin = Certificate.Export(X509ContentType.Pfx, password);

Background: Certificate is an X509Certificate2 with only a public key. RSA is a RSACryptoServiceProvider containing the private key corresponding to the same public key. The certificate is created by a remote ACME-compliant CA (Let's Encrypt), which is why only the public key is available, and why the private key is kept separate by the client.
The code runs without exception on Windows 10, and the generated PFX file contains the private key as it should.
The question is: Why does it throw an exception in one case, but not the other? And what would the suggested work-around be?

","Prerequisite
From your question I gather you're on macOS, most likely macOS 10.12 which stopped autoloading SSH keys into the keychain and creating this situation. 
However, the Walkthrough is valid for all OS/Tower versions.
Use Tower's Service Interface to prepare SSH key loading
Navigate to Tower's service view with Cmd+Ctrl+S.
In the bottom left click the + to choose ""Add Custom Server""
As authentication information enter
Server name: ssh://git@git.wpengine.com
Choose SSH Key authentication and enter your credentials
Cloning Repositories
Should now work as expected
Existing Repositories - make sure they're linked to your Service
Open your repository in Tower, click your remote in the sidebar (most likely origin)
Hover the Fetch URL to reveal the ""Edit"" button
Press it and make sure your Custom Service is selected in this dialog
Test by clicking ""Fetch""

","I came across this while trying to add my wpengine repositories to Tower and had to try a few different URLs before getting the correct one. The connection is specific to the repository not the account, unlike in the terminal. 
This URL scheme worked: ssh://git@git.wpengine.com/production/repo.git 
The username in the form field is git and you select the correct SSH key in the dropdown (just as Samuel stated above).

^I have no idea what all that means. Its like using FIPS mode won't allow that algorithm! What will it allow then???
","OK so I figured this out after thinking about the errors more and spotting this:
https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(3)
If I call OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() after I call FIPS_mode_set(1) then PEM_write_bio_RSAPrivateKey works. That is, this does not throw an error:
rc = PEM_write_bio_RSAPrivateKey(
        pem5.get(), //binary file pointer
        rsa.get(), //key in use
        EVP_aes_256_cbc(), //cipher to use
        NULL,
        0,
        NULL,
        password_ca
    );

Then I call EVP_cleanup() after I'm done to free up memory from the OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() call.

I have Following doubts which i mentioned below ..
1.Is there is any way to recover my private keys?(I'm having old distribution certificate)
2.If I revoked my distribution certificate, but I have  uploaded two apps by using those certificate so,Those app will affect by this setp?
3.If i created new Certificate then can i upload the new version of the existing app
please help me i Forgot Live applications private key and now I need to upload a new version of existing app any help will be very appreciable.
","No, you can't recover the lost key. Create a new key and add it to your keychain. Then create a new certificate with the new key. Create updated provisioning profiles with the new certificate. Use the new provisioning profiles to build and submit app updates.
None of this will affect your existing apps already in the App Store.

"52396203","How can I add a private key to a certificate in the windows trust store in c++?","I have a file with a certificate in it, and I have a file with a private key file in it.
if I run this command
certutil –MergePFX certfile.cer certfile.pfx
I get a pfx file that if I run with explorer, it runs the windows certificate import wizard. If I run through the wizard, I end up with the cert with the key in the windows trust store. Exactly what I need.
I'm trying to do this programatically.
The problem seems to be in the CertAddCertificateContextToStore function.
In the remarks it says: 

The certificate context is not duplicated using CertDuplicateCertificateContext. Instead, the function creates a new copy of the context and adds it to the store. In addition to the encoded certificate, CertDuplicateCertificateContext also copies the context's properties, with the exception of the CERT_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID and CERT_KEY_CONTEXT_PROP_ID properties.

So certduplicatecertificatecontext very specifically will not copy the private key, and it seems that CertAddCertificateContextToStore doesn't either.
I have a HCRYPTPROV struct with my private key and I use CERT_KEY_CONTEXT_PROP_ID and CERT_KEY_PROV_HANDLE_PROP_ID (I tried them both) to CertSetCertificateContextProperty my certificate context, and then I store it in the windows trust store with CertAddCertificateContextToStore. And no matter what I try, the certificate goes in without the private key.
I'm verifying this with the certmgr tool that shows if a private key is attached, and I can also see it not work when I use that client certificate in a curl request I'm making.
Another thing I tried was this:
The last parameter to CertAddCertificateContextToStore is the handle to the copy of the context that is made. I figure the original context is the one I created where I read the certificate in from disk. This new certificate is the one tied to the actual on-disk store that certmgr reads.
So after I call CertAddCertificateContextToStore, I take the new cert and I add the private key, again via CertSetCertificateContextProperty, and then for good measure, I call CertControlStore to push the in-memory version of the context to disk. Still no effect. Every function call succeeds, but the private key never makes it to the windows trust store.
So in short, my question is what is the windows certificate import tool doing that I am not that will allow me to store a private key along with the certificate in the windows trust store?
I've found a handful of other questions and program examples and message boards dating back to 2002 and none are very explicit, and none of the code examples do exactly what I need, but I know I have all the pieces, they just don't yield the result.
","I strongly believe that you set incorrect properties. You should set only CERT_KEY_PROV_INFO_PROP_ID context property in the CertSetCertificateContextProperty call to associate certificate with private key.
If you have a HCRYPTPROV handle, then you have all necessary information to construct CRYPT_KEY_PROV_INFO structure.

I created public and private keys with a passphrase like the documentation says, and it works great on my local machine, yet I do not know how to create or copy those files to Heroku. 
","You probably have something like that in your config.yml:
lexik_jwt_authentication:
    private_key_path: '%kernel.root_dir%/var/jwt/private.pem'   
    public_key_path:  '%kernel.root_dir%/var/jwt/public.pem'

In my case this resolves to a path like /app/var/jwt/ and in that folder I have two files private.pem and public.pem.
You say it's running in dev, so you should have something similar.
So you just have to upload/checkin/deploy the folder structure and files with your standard deployment (Symfony and other) files to Heroku. What is your exact issue?
Strong recommendation:
You should have different set of key pairs for every environment, so in a minimal setup you shouldn't define the lexik_jwt_authentication not in your config.yml but twice, in your config_dev.yml and your config_prod.yml and and have a different set of pem files for dev and prod.

","With LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle v2.5.0, this is now possible to give keys as environment variables : commit 154c60e90b8f10e1fdca819a681b5f189e8ed9ef.
Replace keys path for string keys in lexik_jwt_authentication.yaml :
Before :
lexik_jwt_authentication:
    private_key_path: '%kernel.project_dir%/%env(JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH)%'
    public_key_path: '%kernel.project_dir%/%env(JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH)%'

After :
lexik_jwt_authentication:
    secret_key: '%env(JWT_SECRET_KEY)%'
    public_key: '%env(JWT_PUBLIC_KEY)%'

I didn't find a solution to paste full keys as string in .env file, so I kept private_key_path and public_key_path in config/dev/lexik_jwt_authentication.yaml for my dev environment, and used secret_key and public_key only in config/prod/lexik_jwt_authentication.yaml, for my Heroku production.
To finish, add env variables on Heroku, deploy and you're done :

"17601369","OS X: What might cause ssh-agent to stop providing passphrase for encrypted SSH private key?","As far as I can tell, the only thing I did was modify my ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, because I set up a new Parallels VM with a Bridged Network Adapter and the client Linux gained a local LAN IP which matched a previous entry in the known hosts file (thus preventing me from connecting to it). 
(I'm not sure if this is the cause, but) I edited my known hosts file, and sometime after, when pushing to git, SSH started asking me to provide the password for the private key, which it had never done up to that point (since setting up the machine in February).
I now realize I should have at least run ssh with a verbose flag to see what was happening, and i have since learned about ssh-add and ssh-agent and all that, and I'm guessing ssh-add -l might have told me it stopped ""tracking"" it or something so i could ""re-add"" it with ssh-add.  
My question is, could manually editing the known hosts file possibly have triggered ssh-agent to stop saving the private key passphrase as a security measure? If not, is there anything that would trigger this, that I may have inadvertently done between the times that I did any pushing with git?
What I did was: 

verify my ~/.ssh/id_rsa was encrypted. Got slightly confused about why I never got prompted for said passphrase (hardly remember setting it up with one, but I probably did)
decrypted it with openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa
got my pushing done
found out about ssh-agent, thought, hmm, explains why I never got prompted for passphrase, I should set it up like it was since my file is now plaintext
encrypted it with ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

And I was slightly surprised to find that it is no longer asking me for the private key encryption passphrase anymore after I re-encrypted the private key using that last command. ssh-add -l now reports one entry (mentioning that very file, ~/.ssh/id_rsa). I only wish I ran ssh-add -l prior to decrypting the private key. 
Is everything still kosher?  Did I get hacked?
","I had the same thing happen and was likewise concerned about being hacked.  I still don't know exactly what happened, which is disconcerting.  
Anyway, here's what I do whenever I'm suddenly asked for my passphrase:  
$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
$ ssh-add

It will ask me one more time for my passphrase then that's it.

","Option 1:
You'd be better of doing this sequentially. Your rand() can find numbers that have been used previously. Let's say your max is 10, the requred number is 8 or 4, with rand() you could get 3,5,9,10,3,6,2,7,3,6,9,10,1,3,5,6,3,7,8 before hitting an answer. If you run sequentially, you have a max of 10 calls to get it.
But, you need a random number, so you probably should start at a random number, then increase sequentially until you get a hit - that way you could get 8, or you could get 4, depending on your start point.
Option 2:
After that, there are other solutions you can mathematically do. Start with a random number, work out what the modulus is, and the difference from 1 (if negative, add $phi). Then you can run from 1 to $decrypt to find out what number modded gives teh difference from 1, and then add that to encrypt for your response.
$decrypt = 7
$encrypt = 9
$phi = 3
($decrypt * $encrypt) % ($phi) = 0
$differenceInMod = 1 - ($decrypt * $encrypt) % ($phi) = 1;
if ($differenceInMod < 0) {
    $differenceInMod+=$phi;
}
for($i = 1; $i<$decrypt; $i++) {
   if (($decrypt * $i) % ($phi) == $differenceInMod) {
      $validEncrypt = $encrypt + $i;
      break;
   }
}

Probably no faster that stright sequential (option 1) - but numbers are smaller and you have limits.

That's where your biggest vulnerability is.
Protocols such as TLS (which can use RSA) SSH and PGP provide a well defined mechanism for negotiating encryption, and implementations such as openssl provide a documented, tested, portable, robust and we'll tested abstraction layer. 
Rolling your own solution carries massive risks of injecting vulnerabilities. And entails ongoing pain in maintenance.
BTW RC4 is considered broken by many people.

Which secure vulnerabilities exist with a such way? Consider, that use of TLS is the STRICT option.
","It depends on your application. There are at least couple of issues with generating private key on server.

Client must trust you are not saving this key for later. You know that you don't but client does not know that. Depending on application it might be important distinction.
Even if you send key over TLS, it still can be intercepted by man in the middle under certain circumstances. For example, company might install trusted root certificate on each computer in organization, then intercept and decrypt all ssl traffic which goes in\out this organisation. Again that might or might not be important depending on the type of your application.

Suppose that you write chat application targeted at large audience, and want to encrypt all messages between users. Then if you will generate keys on server - no one will (or at least should) use your application. First you can dump all their keys to government\whatever (they cannot be 100% sure this cannot happen), and even if you won't do that - there are whole countries where ssl traffic is inspected by using ""fake"" trusted root certificates.
So long story short - if you can generate private keys on client - do that. In your case I think you can.

"37051366","Is it a bad idea to generate private keys (certs) at server side?","I'm working with some encryption project (using C#) and there is a task, which I'm thinking how to do well.
I need client to generate private keys for asymmetric encryption, but as I have reviewed some libraries, it's NOT such clean & easy task.
Why?
For generating private keys in Windows, I have the next possibilities:

generate them using makecert.exe, pvk2pfx.exe etc... but these tools
are from Windows SDK and seems to be they're linked with other DLLs,
so if client have a clean OS (without any installed library) I may:
1). Install Windows SDK on client's PC 2). Copy makecert.exe and other utilities and
hold it with the project distribution (I think, it's a bad idea due different Windows versions (from 7 to 10) and 32/64 bits architecture

Which secure vulnerabilities exist with a such way? Consider, that use of TLS is the STRICT option.
","Depends upon multiple considerations!

What do your users expect?  Designs that aim to provide ""zero-knowledge"" solutions such as SpiderOak guarantee that not even a person with full admin access to the server can decrypt your data.  In this case, generating the key on the server and promising that you do not store it doesn't cut it: anybody with full admin access to the server could break that promise any time.  So to achieve real zero-knowledge, you would have to generate keys on client side.
Are you willing to accept the performance impact?  Does it open DoS vectors?  Maybe because I am a security guy, I absolutely would not be doing it on the server.

If I were you, I would be pursuing BouncyCastle on client side.

p = 3
q = 11
n = 33
phi = 20
e = 7
d = 3

If I want to encrypt the number 123, I would do (123^7) % 33, which equals18.
Now if I want to decrypt 18, I do (18^3) % 33, which gives me 24.
As you can see, the input number and decrypted number is not the same. Does anyone know why this is? Also does this mean I have to break the number 123 up into single digits and then encrypt 1, 2 and 3 separately?
EDIT: I am aware that due to the value of n, anything I mod by n would be lower than n. Does that mean I have to intially choose very large numbers for p and q?
","From the Wikipedia page for RSA (my emphasis):

Bob then wishes to send message M to Alice.
He first turns M into an integer m, such that 0 <= m < n by using an
  agreed-upon reversible protocol known as a padding scheme. He then
  computes the ciphertext c corresponding to
c = m^e (mod n)


Your m (123) is not less than n (33), so it doesn't work. So yes, you would need to start with larger p and q to get a larger n.

What they are asking is the following:

Certificate with 4096 bits public key for encryption (.pem or .cer

SSL certificate for sending callback response on call back URL.

I generated the self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL & shared with them along with the private key (I know we shouldn't). They asked me to share a valid public key & SSL certificate. 
I even generated a certificate & private key on DigiCert, but couldn't figure out how to generate a public key for SSL Certificate.  
Can anyone kindly suggest how to generate Public key & private key for the SSL Certificate? 
Kindly also suggest if I can use Comodo or DigiCert to generate a public key for the SSL certificate?
","An SSL Certificate is a public key verified and signed by a Certificate Authority. You generate a public/private key pair, then from that generate a Certificate Signing Request (which includes the public key), which you send to the CA. It then signs that public key included in the CSR producing the certificate which is sends back to you. See also here.
It sounds like you already have this though, so you'd need to clarify what you're trying to achieve. It sounds like it may be a client authentication / mutual authentication scenario? If so, it depends on what the service provider requires - certificates for client authentication may need to be signed either by a public authority that the server trusts, or by the server itself.

"54122006","How to securely reference a .json private key file from a Java app running on Google Cloud","I'm working on an app that will run on the Google Cloud Platform, and it needs to authenticate to the Google Admin 'Directory' SDK. The recommended approach that everyone (including Google) seems to suggest, is to create a service account in the Google Cloud Platform, and use the private key credentials for the service account to authenticate within the app that's running on Google Cloud Platform. Here is Google's recommended approach:
Perform G Suite Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority
To summarise the approach, for a Java app it requires the following:

Upload the private key file to a file location available application (the private key file can be JSON instead of P12 as suggested in the above guide)
Programatically load the file in the application, and use its credentials to authenticate

My question is this - if the file is directly uploaded to the src/main/resources folder for the application that runs on the Google Cloud Platform, is this is a significant security risk? How easy would it be for a hacker to access the file? If it's a risk, then what is a secure alternative to this approach?
","For this answer I will assume that you are running on Google Compute Engine. The same type of answer will apply to App Engine, Containers, Kubernetes and Cloud Functions.

My question is this - if the file is directly uploaded to the
  src/main/resources folder for the application that runs on the Google
  Cloud Platform, is this is a significant security risk?

This is a security risk and is a very poor security practice. Numerous prominent companies have been breached with credentials stored in source code.

How easy would it be for a hacker to access the file?

Unknown. There are many different types of breaches. If a hacker obtains shell access to your instance you are in serious trouble. If a hacker obtains root shell access, they can do almost anything they want.

If it's a risk, then what is a secure alternative to this approach?

Best practices for security regarding credentials: do not store credentials in your source code or on your computing resources.
Normally you would access your credentials from Compute Engine Metadata server. These credentials are created by Google Cloud when your instance starts up. You can control these permissions in the Google Console under ""Cloud API access scopes"" OR via a service account that you specify for the VM.
However, with G-Suite, you need to create delegated credentials. I do not recommend mixing the credentials that are used by your VM with the credentials used for G-Suite. This means that you still need access to credentials in Json format (or P12 for legacy applications).
Since best security practices are to not store these credentials in source code or on the instance, you need to store them securely someplace else that you can access securely. One option is Google Cloud Storage. Assign a Cloud Storage read-only scope to your instance so that you can read the credentials Json file from Cloud Storage. Read the credentials using your SDK directly into memory and do not involve disk operations or utilities such as gsutil. I recommend that you create a seperate bucket for privileged files such as credentials.
Note that you are using several credentials. 1) the credentials stored in Google's metadata server. 2) the credentials that you download from Cloud Storage. 3) the delegated credentials that you create to access G-Suite and other Google applications.
The first set of credentials (Application Default Credentials - ADC) are used for normal cloud access including reading the second set of credentials from Cloud Storage. The third set are created in your software.
The credentials that you store on Cloud Storage do not need any privileges except domain wide delegation. The privileges are added via scopes when you create the G-Suite credentials (credentials #3).
Note: Do not store the email address used for delegated credentials in your source code. Store this in another Json file on Cloud Storage.

I'd like to be able to reproduce what openssl_private_encrypt() generates with OpenSSL directly, but for some reason I'm not getting the same results. What is openssl_private_encrypt() doing with OpenSSL exactly?
OpenSSL's RSA_private_encrypt() is being used by PHP's openssl_private_encrypt() according to the PHP source code. The same OpenSSL method is being used by openssl rsautl -sign according to a different source. The same (default) padding -pkcs is also being used. Yet I can't seem to reproduce the same encryption result.
The following PHP code:

The passwords will be encrypted and stored in a database. We can't use checksums because we need to show the passwords in plaintext.
The problem is that we couldn't find a good solution to store the private key. If it's written in the code, you can get it quite easily. If it's hidden in a dll, you can't hide it effectively, because the machine has to use it. All users of our software have full access to the source code, the database with the encripted passwords and are admins on their PCs, so they could read the code when it's used.
We thought about storing the private keys in a seperate database which is accessed with another password but the key will be used anyway. 
So, we're not getting anywhere. We are aware that there is no 100% save solution for this but there got to be an almost safe one.
","First i would advise against writing your own solution, there are so many ways to do it wrong, and you need to invest a lot of time to know about all important points.
You don't need to store a key anywhere, just use the key to encrypt the data then forget the key. For decrypting you use the key as entered, if the key is correct you get back the data, otherwise you get back scrambled content.
Because users do not like to type strong keys and prefere passwords, you should use a key-derivation function like BCrypt or PBKDF2 (Password-Based-Key-Derivation-Function-2), which can translate a password to a key.

So did I; I've modified my header and footer, but Wireshark is still incapable of loading the private key.
Any ideas on how I can make this work?
","Changing the header and footer doesn't change the contents.
If you started off with the certificate (which only contains the public key) then changing the header and footer to BEGIN/END RSA PRIVATE KEY doesn't change the file to a private key.
You need to get hold of the original private key file.
Also, if you stop and think about it, a certificate is public information.  If all that were needed to decrypt a TLS/SSL connection was a certificate then all the secure communications in the world would be compromised.

Is there any security risk with Dev 1 still having copies of all these certificates/keys? If I revoke his access to the company Apple Developer Program account can he do anything with them?
Which certificates/keys are needed by Dev 2 to be able to sign and publish an update to the app?

"39457836","SSLv3 mutual authentication using libcurl and smart card","I need some help to establish a communication channel to consume a webservice using SSLv3 with mutual authentication, libcurl and a smart card, which will store the client certificate, the key pair and will be responsible for signatures, encryptions, etc.
For testing purposes, without using the smart card, the following brief code runs smoothly:
....
(SOAP message configurations)
....

curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_USE_SSL, CURLUSESSL_ALL);
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_SSLVERSION, 3);
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1);

curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2);
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_SSLCERT, ""clientCertificateFile"");
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD, ""testPrivateKeyPass"");
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_SSLKEY, ""testPrivateKeyFile"");
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO, ""CAcertificateFile"");
curl_easy_setopt (curl, CURLOPT_URL, ""URLtoWebService"");

curl_easy_perform (curl);

After running this code, I can establish communication using SSLv3 and get the expected response from the webservice. However, I need to establish this secure channel using the smart card. I have free access to the following information:

""clientCertificateFile"" - stored on the smart card, in PEM format. It can be read through access function.
""CAcertificateFile"" - stored on disk, in PEM format. It can be read through access function.
""URLtoWebService"" - stored in the application.

""testPrivateKeyFile"" and ""testPrivateKeyPass"" are temporary files used only for testing and should be replaced by the smart card.
My doubt is: How to use the smart card to replace the private key and password in the libcurl setup process?
The smart card does not allow access to private key, only to the public key, as expected. I can send to the smart card data to be signed or encrypted, using the private key, and get the resulting buffer.
Is there any way to redirect part of the SSLv3 connection handshake to use my smart card? Some setting in lib ssl, or libcurl?

","The problem with hosting an HTTPS webserver on an android device is that the certificates are validated using a domain name. Without a domain name the client browser will display an error unless the server certificate is installed and trusted locally.

Register a domain name, use dynamic dns, and then request an ssl/tls certificate based on that name.

I've been digging the Internet and what I have gathered is that in the end there no 100% safe way to store a private key. However, it is considered good practice to safe all keys in a KeyStore. The following is my solution to it, but my problem is: the KeyStore-file, client.jks, lies inside the JAR, together with the hardcoded password. client.jks contains the server-side's public key and the client-side's private key.
        KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
        keyStore.load(new FileInputStream(KEYSTORE), PASSWORD.toCharArray());

        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(""SunX509"");

The Strings KEYSTORE and PASSWORD contain the KeyStore-file and the password, both hardcoded.
Is this really the best practice or am I missing something? Is the new SecureRandom object created for every connection enough to make the connection safe?

token verification :
String token = generateRSASignedToken(claimsSet);
                JWSVerifier verifier = new RSASSAVerifier(getPublicKey());
                SignedJWT jwt=null;

                    jwt = SignedJWT.parse(token);
                    System.out.println(jwt.verify(verifier));

                    e.printStackTrace();
                } 

every thing looks fine from token generation part to getting public and private key but verification part is not working. It is printing false for the key pair generated. It was working fine with key pair I got from online tool(which I can't use due to licensing problem) but not when I generated keys.
","The problem is here:
String publicKey  = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(keyGen.genKeyPair().getPublic().getEncoded());
String privateKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(keyGen.genKeyPair().getPrivate().getEncoded());

Every time you call genKeyPair() a new key pair is generated. Thus publicKey and privateKey come from different and unrelated key pairs. The solution is simply to save the key pair just generated, e.g.
KeyPair kp = keyGen.genKeyPair();
String publicKey  = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(kp.getPublic().getEncoded());
String privateKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(kp.getPrivate().getEncoded());

NOTE: there may be other problems with the code, this is the first one I spotted.

","In general, private keys contain enough information to rebuild public keys (it's the opposite, computing the private key from the public key, which is hopefully not feasible). In the case of a normal RSA private key in Java, you would use java.lang.security.KeyFactory.getKeySpec() to obtain a java.security.spec.RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec instance, that contains, among other things, the modulus (getModulus()) and the public exponent (getPublicExponent()), i.e. the two elements of the public key.
Now, of course, your code is not a generator for an RSA key pair, but for an elliptic curve key pair, which is an altogether different animal. There again, though, the private key contains enough information to recompute the public key. However, this involves an elliptic curve multiplication, an operation which is doable (that's the kind of operation used when signing or verifying an ECDSA signature) but for which I am not sure there is a ready-to-use API in Java.
In any case, when you generate the private key, you actually generate a key pair with both the private key and the public key. If you store a copy of the public key along with the private key, then you do not have to worry about recomputing the public key.

","The correct answer to the question was given by Maarten Bodewes:

""I use a RSA private key to encrypt a given plain text."". You should stop right there. Encryption with an RSA private key is not signature generation and it does not provide confidentiality of the message either; it is not a secure cipher. You encrypt with the public key and decrypt with the private key, period. –

I don't have access to the container's file system, so I deploy the pk12 file in my WAR's WEB-INF/ . I don't anticipate being given access to add any authentication keys into the Servlet Container's host's system registry/keychain.
GoogleCredential's Buidler.setServiceAccountPrivateKeyFromP12File(File) only takes java.io.File, so I ended up doing something that is kludgey to authorize. I open the PK12 file using serveltContenxt.getResourceAsStream and copy it's contents to a temporary file which I pass into the Credential's builder. 
When I tried to do 
java.io.File p12File = new java.io.File(servletContext.getResource('...pk12.file...').getFile()) 

there was an error saying that the File doesn't exists because it tries to open a file on disk while the pk12 file is either not unbundled or the URI that comes back isn't the correct one for the file. 
What's the right way to do this? I'm new to the world of PrivateKey authentication and the google client api.

"33792468","Private key parameters in C#","I got an application that in C#, using RSACryptoServiceProvider, I load a public key from an XML and then I'm encrypting a hash value and saving it. 
In another application, I load the private key and then I'm able to decrypt the information correctly.
The problem is that I want to make quick tests to see if everything's ok. 
From MSDN, 

The security of RSA derives from the fact that, given the public key { e, n }, it is computationally infeasible to calculate d, either directly or by factoring n into p and q. Therefore, any part of the key related to d, p, or q must be kept secret. 

so the most important parameters of the private key are the exponent and the primes (D, P, Q). 
My test was to modify the private key before loading it. First, I changed one character in the first prime and I got a bad key. Same when just modifying one character in the second prime. 
But when I modified one character in the exponent, it was still able to correctly decode it. So my question is, which things can be changed from the private key and still be able to decode, and which are essential?
","While Modulus, Exponent, and D are all that are required to do RSA technically, very few implementations actually use D, because it's much more efficient to do RSA via the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
While the Windows CAPI (used by RSACryptoServiceProvider) will roundtrip any value of D you import, it doesn't actually use it. Windows CNG (used by RSACng) requires that D be provided on import of a private key, then promptly throws it away, recomputing it on export (or import, I suppose). 
You can see that last quirk by generating an RSA key with OpenSSL (which generates d via phi (which is the form Wikipedia mentions) and importing it into CNG, which when exporting has replaced d with the calculation based on lambda (LCM(p-1, q-1)).
Anyways, what all this amounts to is that while ""changing D is bad"" it can, in practice, just be ignored by the library doing the actual math; and that seems to be the case here.  But you shouldn't do it, because it might not interoperate well after going via a PFX or other private key transfer mechanism.

WHAT HAS TO BE ACHIEVED

Generate SECP256K1 key pair
Use public key for account creation on a blockchain
Store private key to Key Vault and use it for signing purposes

ATTEMPT #1 - GENERATE OUTSIDE KEY VAULT AND IMPORT
I have generated SECP256K1 key pair outside Key Vault. As a result I have private key and public key available as strings.
My idea was to import the private key to Key Vault with help of Azure SDK for.NET wia following piece of code (ECParameters used are from Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.WebKey.ECParameters namespace):
  //this part of code is taken from https://www.scottbrady91.com/C-Sharp/JWT-Signing-using-ECDSA-in-dotnet-Core
  var privateKeyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(privateKey);
  var privateKeyInt =
    new Org.BouncyCastle.Math.BigInteger(+1, privateKeyBytes);
  var parameters = SecNamedCurves.GetByName(""secp256k1"");
  var ecPoint = parameters.G.Multiply(privateKeyInt);
  var privateKeyX = ecPoint.Normalize().XCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();
  var privateKeyY = ecPoint.Normalize().YCoord.ToBigInteger()
    .ToByteArrayUnsigned();

  //the following part is my code
  var ecParameters = new ECParameters();
  ecParameters.Curve = ""P-256K"";
  ecParameters.X = privateKeyX;
  ecParameters.Y = privateKeyY;
  ecParameters.D = privateKeyBytes;

  var key = new JsonWebKey(ecParameters);
  JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options options =
    JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyIncompatibleOperations
    | JsonWebKeyVerifier.Options.DenyExtraneousFields;
  string error = (string) null;

  JsonWebKeyVerifier.VerifyByKeyType(key, options, ref error);

  await client.ImportKeyWithHttpMessagesAsync(vaultBaseUri, name, key);

The resulting key for import looks like this (copied from Visual Studio variable view, maybe it's shortened):
  {
    ""kty"": ""EC"",
    ""crv"": ""P-256K"",
    ""x"": ""vSUHj6deEhPI6QeILgfgf2I7VTgmiDon_5nsss560OA"",

    ""d"": ""NUpoaEEzWTFVYXBKNWZuRWZNUkVxZkpKY29LWGdMcHpFUnVNQ2E2Wjd0YkNhY2NpQ3N5""

ATTEMPT #2 - GENERATE WITHIN KEY VAULT AND EXPORT
Even if I'm able to generate SECP256K1 EC key within Key Vault, I didn't find how to export its public key part.
EDIT 11/23/2018
GetKey method on Azure Key Vault returns JsonWebKey that contains X and Y coordinates.
QUESTIONS

Is it possible to import SECP256K1 key via Azure SDK for .NET? If yes, could you provide me a link to working example?
Am I doing something wrong/insufficent in my code during attempt to import the key to Key Vault?
Is it possible to export SECP256K1 public key from Key Vault?
Do you have any other idea how to accomplish the achievements described herein before?

EDIT 11/29/2018

Is there a way how to construct public key from X and Y coordinates (ideally in .NET world)?

Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Jan
PS: I originally posted this question on Azure Key Vault blog, but here is probably much broader audience. I'll link both sources once it will be answered,

The problem I encountered is the following.
In the docs you are told to generate a private key JSON file and securely store it.
Usually I store my keys in an os.env variable. But this is not possible, since this is a whole file and not just a value. Also on the same page, the doc tells you how to get a request token:
def _get_access_token():
  """"""Retrieve a valid access token that can be used to authorize requests.

As you can see here, the library needs direct access to the file.
So my question is? How do I securely store this? I'm currently hosting on heroku, so I need this in my version control system.
","Most teams keep the JSON file out of version control and add to the environment manually. 
While not exactly the same as keeping the values in an environment variable, it has similar security. A developer with only access to version control can't access the key, and a developer cannot accidentally run on their own system with the production keys. But on the other hand: someone who has access to the production server, can get the key in both cases.

","this is Based on what ivanspenchev suggested in his post.
Flow is : read json data -> encrypt with a key - > decrypt with a key.  I am not using his suggested encrypt algo, because I dont like it.

java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: java.lang.RuntimeException: error:0c0000af:ASN.1 encoding routines:OPENSSL_internal:TOO_LONG
I tried searching for situations where this had already happened but could find none. I would like to know what this error means and how I can solve it.
Here is my code:
public static String decryptionWithFile(String encrypted,String privateFile2)throws Exception  {
    PrivateKey privateKey = getPrivateKey(privateFile2);

    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey);

And here is the getPrivateKey(); Method:

    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);
    DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(fis);
    byte[] keyBytes = new byte[(int) f.length()];
    dis.readFully(keyBytes);
    dis.close();

    PKCS8EncodedKeySpec spec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(keyBytes);
    RSAPrivateKey privKey = (RSAPrivateKey) keyFactory.generatePrivate(spec);
    return privKey;
}

Important Note: I added the .der file to my assets folder and then saved it to a file in Internal Storage in order to access the path - which my function requires. Do you think, anything must have happened to the file during this process? (It worked fine with the Public Key)
","The problem turned out to be what I'd guessed. When I was writing the .der file to the Internal Storage, it was getting altered somehow and thus wasn't working.
So instead of that. I directly used the InputStream returned from getAssets().open(filename) to read the private key. That fixed it.

My iOS application will decrypt a QRCode using this algorithme. the QRCode is encrypted using Java by a public key like below. to decrypt this code, we use the code above on Java side. so how we can generate the same privatekey that will be able to decrypt ? is it possible to do it without the same modulus and exponent ?
byte[] modulusBytes = Base64.decode(""base64EncodedString"");

byte[] exponentBytes = Base64.decode(""AQAB"");
BigInteger modulus = new BigInteger(1, modulusBytes );
BigInteger exponent = new BigInteger(1, exponentBytes);

RSAPublicKeySpec rsaPubKey = new RSAPublicKeySpec(modulus, exponent);
KeyFactory fact = KeyFactory.getInstance(""RSA"");
PublicKey pubKey = fact.generatePublic(rsaPubKey);

","This is not the way it is supposed to work. You could generate a pair of private and public keys on each side, and exchange the public keys. The each side would encrypt the messages they wish to send (provided they are not too long) with the other side's public key, and decrypt the received messages with their own private key. But the private key is and should remain just that, private.

Now the certificate is there in console root\certificates (local computer)\personal\certificates but its not appearing in IIS for binding. The team is now asking me for the private key to resolve the issue.
Can someone let me how to get the private key from the .cer and .keystore file?
And if you can point out the reason why certificate is not appearing in IIS and how to resolve it, I would really appreacite that.

In my case, the certificate received from CA was directly installed, thats why it was not private key verified, and was not appearing in IIS also. We had to import the public key(the .cer file) to the keystore 
keytool -importcert -file certificate.cer -keystore <server name>.keystore -alias <server name>

and then convert the keystore to a PKCS#12, with:
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <server name>.keystore -destkeystore <server name>.pfx -srcstoretype JKS - deststoretype PKCS12 -deststorepass <new password>

Then we imported the pfx in certificate store.

The decrypted string should end with ""=="".Can someone kindly help me to figure out, how to remove the special characters at the end of the decrypted string.

","These values at the end must have been added during encryption. They are probably 00 valued bytes that were added by a language with null terminated strings or similar. The point is that PKCS#1 unpadding will fail if the ciphertext itself is altered, so the only reasonable explanation is that the values have been included in the plaintext.
Print out the decodedBytes in hexadecimals to find out the values. You can likely get rid of them by using the String#trim() method.

"52111045","C#: Keyset does not exist in Azure Functions on consumption plan","Many of us faced ""Keyset does not esist"" exception when trying to work with X509Certificate2.
The symptoms are:

You load .pfx into X509Certificate2
You use it in any operation requiring private key
You get ""Keyset does not exist"" exception.

In code it looks like the following:
string CreateJWTToken(byte[] certificate, string psw, string serviceUserIss, string serviceUserSub, string serviceUserAud)
    {
        using (X509Certificate2 combinedCertificate = new X509Certificate2(certificate, psw,
              X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet
            | X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet 
            | X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable))
        {
            var signingKey = new X509SecurityKey(combinedCertificate);
            var credentials = new Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.SigningCredentials(signingKey, SecurityAlgorithms.RsaSha256);
            var header = new JwtHeader(credentials);
            var payload = new JwtPayload
            {
               { ""iss"", serviceUserIss},
               { ""sub"", serviceUserSub},
               { ""aud"", serviceUserAud},
               { ""exp"", $""{unixTimestamp}""}
            };
            var secToken = new JwtSecurityToken(header, payload);
            var handler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
            return handler.WriteToken(secToken); // here exception is thrown
        }
    }

It works fine locally, and even in local Azure Functions host, but for some reason it sometimes (like in 5% cases) throws ""Keyset does not exist"" when run in Azure Function (timer-triggered) on consumption plan.
","The issue appeared to be in some nuances of how Azure Functions on consumption plan works with certificates.
I do not know details, but X509Certificate2's PrivateKey is sometimes cleared by... By something. Is it aggressive garbage collector? Is it something related to auto-scaling, or to resources shared between different hosts? I do not know.
But issue seems to be resolved by avoiding usage of X509Certificate2, by using BouncyCastle's mechanism to load private key from PFX. See code snippet below.
Snippet below also uses Jose.JWT for creating JWT token.

               { ""aud"", serviceUserAud},
            jwt = Jose.JWT.Encode(payload, rsax, Jose.JwsAlgorithm.RS256);
        }
        return jwt;

Is there a java equivalent to OpenSSL's bn_rand_range?
Essentially, you should use SecureRandom, and use the method given there, namely:
Random r = new SecureRandom();    
BigInteger q = something_big;
BigInteger ans;

do

I want to make guidelines to users so they know which keys they can use and which one they can't. Hence the question: how can I determine the format of an ssh private key file, going beyond the RSA/etc and the number of bits?
For instance, at the end of this question is a 3072 bit RSA key that was generated using ssh-keygen with no parameters on android/termux. it works in ssh but both JSch and JuiceSSH refuse to even open it. openssl rsa -text -noout -in file says:

I can fix this by running ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f file, and this might be a workaround for some users, but it would help to know in advance which formats work and which don't.

","There's no definitive answer to your question. It's basically something that should be part of your software specification.
But to give some answer:
If the application uses the key for its internal use, i.e. the end user is not aware that the application uses SSH/SFTP to send some data somewhere, the key should be part of the application.
In that case, either deploy the key to your application installation folder or embed it into your binary.

Note that this is obviously a security issue. As long as your application need to contain credentials (be it private key or password) of your server, the end user can get hold of the credentials and abuse them. No matter how hard you try to hide them.
So the credentials must have as little privileges as possible. For example, if the application uploads files to the server, the account for which the private key (or password) is for, should allow only the upload and nothing else. It should not allow modification of existing files. It should not even allow listing of exiting files. It should have a limit on file size. Etc, etc. If you are not experienced with this, you really need to get this set up by someone experienced.

","With the following lines:
byte[] prvk1 = new byte[(int)new File(""C:\\...\\""+T_Username.getText()+""\\private_""+ T_Username.getText()).length()];

and
byte[] encBytes = new byte[(int)new File(""C:\\...\\""+T_Username.getText()+""\\hash_""+ T_Username.getText()).length()];

You actually create two empty byte arrays. You only indicate the size of the array using File.length(), which obviously is not correct. Try again after actually reading the files, e.g. using the readAllBytes method (requires Java 8 or higher).

P.S. pkcs8 to pkcs1 convertion was found here
","As indicated, the private key is in X9.62 format. It cannot be in PKCS#1 format because that format specifies RSA, not ECC.
Furthermore, your PKCS#8 private key contains more information than the X9.62 formatted private key that you've extracted from it. You can see the decoding of PKCS#8 here:
SEQUENCE (3 elem)
  INTEGER 0
  SEQUENCE (2 elem)
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.2.840.10045.2.1 ecPublicKey (ANSI X9.62 public key type)
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER 1.3.132.0.10 secp256k1 (SECG (Certicom) named elliptic curve)

      [1] (1 elem)
        BIT STRING (520 bit) ... the optional public key ...

The internal X9.62 key is the sequence within the octet string and the secret (S) is the 32 byte octet string.
So you have to add back the information. This is an AlgorithmIdentifier that indicates ecPublicKey operations as well as the curve used (repeated for the public key).
So without further ado, the operations to recreate the PKCS#8 structure (with x962 replacing pkcs1):
ASN1Primitive prim = ASN1Primitive.fromByteArray(x962);
PrivateKeyInfo keyInfo = new PrivateKeyInfo(new AlgorithmIdentifier(
        X9ObjectIdentifiers.id_ecPublicKey,
        SECObjectIdentifiers.secp256k1), prim);

note that this is the non-encrypted variant of PKCS#8 which just shows the private key type. The encrypted variant encrypts this structure and adds information on the used wrapping mechanism (e.g. AES encrypted).

When server sends its certificate for client to validate, how exactly does client validate that it is a valid CA cert. It has a collection of trusted CA certs, ok - but how exactly are they used to verify that it was a valid CA that signed the server's certificate using the signature and public key of the server certificate? What things are compared to make sure it was not forged?
Is there any point in encrypting your internal self signed certs? How about an internal root cert? Or is the private key the only one worth encrypting?
If we don't keep a database of encrypted data for our web service (over SSL) for example, would we ever care about storing our own private key once we generated the self signed cert, and if we do, they why?

","
When you create a CSR, it generates a private key along with it

Or you have already generated your own private key.

and you send it to the CA to generate the cert and sign it

You send the CSR. You don't send your private key. It's private. You don't send it to anyone.

but doesn't the CA use it's own private key to sign?

Yes.

So what is the point of the private key you generated with your CSR?

It pairs with the public key contained in the certificate and it is part of the process used to prove that you and only you own that certificate, as only you can generate digital signatures with that private key that can be verified by the public key in the certificate.

When server sends its certificate for client to validate, how exactly does client validate that it is a valid CA cert. It has a collection of trusted CA certs, ok - but how exactly are they used to verify that it was a valid CA that signed the server's certificate using the signature and public key of the server certificate? What things are compared to make sure it was not forged?

The certificate itself is verified, by verifying its digital signature; it is checked for being within its validity period; and then an attempt is made to form a certificate chain using the alleged signer of the certificate (the 'issuer') and the trusted certificates in the collection.

Is there any point in encrypting your internal self signed certs?

No. They are public documents. Only the private key is private, and that isn't in the certificate.

How about an internal root cert?

No.

Or is the private key the only one worth encrypting?

Yes.

If we don't keep a database of encrypted data for our web service (over SSL) for example, would we ever care about storing our own private key once we generated the self signed cert, and if we do, they why?

Because it's private. It is a critical part of your identity. If you leak it, others can impersonate you.

Read my article on SSH keys to understand the difference between the host key and the key used for authentication.

Host key checking: You should never set the StrictHostKeyChecking to no, unless you connect within a private network, where you do not expect any kind of man-in-the-middle attacks.
Authentication: If possible, use the public key authentications. The password authentication is less secure.

When I connect via IPSwitch, it works all fine. Could you please help me here?Thanks in advance.
","Thanks to  Martin Prikryl and the community for being with this while I solve this problem. 
It was simple. As Martin mention one of his comment, I just had to generate one more set of keys using another tool like SSH-Keygen and use it instead. I used a software called VANDYKE SecureCRT to generate one more set of keys and it works just fine with JSch. Looks like IPSwitch does something while generating keys which does not seem to work with JSch. It could be that 'Pass' which is available in the config file of IPSwitch, which is specific to IPSwitch. 
Code is as follows,
        JSch jsch = new JSch();
        jsch.addIdentity(privateKeyPath);


        JSch.setLogger(new com.jcraft.jsch.Logger() {
            Path path = Paths.get(""target/jsch.log"");
            @Override
            public boolean isEnabled(int level){
                return true;
            }
            public void log(int level, String message){
                try {
                    StandardOpenOption option =
                       !Files.exists(path) ? StandardOpenOption.CREATE : StandardOpenOption.APPEND;
                    Files.write(path, java.util.Arrays.asList(message), option);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.err.println(message);
                }
            }
        });

        Session session = jsch.getSession(username, host, port);

        session.setConfig(""StrictHostKeyChecking"", ""no"");
        session.setConfig(""PreferredAuthentications"", ""publickey"");

I would like to encrypt a message one packet at a time, but if the packet grows, it would no longer just be one packet long.
","Here's a simple scheme: Use public / private key encryption to establish a symmetric key. Then do all of your encryption using that symmetric key.
If you also need to ensure message integrity and non-repudiation, then you can run the message through a hash function, which will map it to a fixed length. Then you can sign the hash.
Typically, you wouldn't want to use public keys to encrypt messages anyway. Public / private key pairs are harder to generate and more expensive to use for long encryption, compared to symmetric keys.

generate private key in browser, using window.crypto
create a PKCS10 certificate signing request in the browser
send the PKCS10 to a server
the server signs the request and returns an x509 certificate in PEM format
the browser stores the certificate for itself

The same thing already works using the keygen tag in the browser and using SPKAC instead of pkcs10. Now, however the browser does not store the certificate returned, just wants to save them. When we try to import the certificate to the browser by hand, we got ""the private key for the certificate is missing or invalid"".
We suspect that the private key generated by window.crypto.generateKey() does not get stored in the browser's keystore. How to get the private key stored in the keystore?
The implementation of the first two steps is based on http://blog.engelke.com/2014/08/23/public-key-cryptography-in-the-browser/
Update: As some browsers use the OS keystore, I am also looking into the possibility to save the key into the OS keystore through some other way.
What I have figured out so far:
Java cannot be used according to this question: Tell Java to use Windows keystore
In Windows one can use ActiveX controls.
Summary: Found no standard cross-browser and cross-OS way to generate and meaningfully use X509 certificates. There are combinations (new chrome versions (dropping keygen support) on non-windows OS) where there is no way to do this.

However the part I'm struggling with is how you convert from the biometrics to the private key.  I assume I need to store the private key somewhere but I can't figure out how.  Otherwise I run the risk of using a very secure system for file storage and then suffering from a far less secure private key.
I'm sure there must be a solution to this, I just can't think of one.
","With biometric you will never get same image or same templates. Everytime you get a new capture, you will have a different image that will supply a different template. So you can`t use it as a key to encrypt some file. You can try to take a hash code from biometric templates. Therefore this is not a good way because noise, rotation, translation and several other things that influence on biometric capture.
There are several academic articles dealing with this subject. But I yet didn`t see one that has a good way to deal with this.
The better way I saw is to use biometric devices to capture a template, match this template with a template previously saved in a database, and if you have a match, release the key kept in a database.
You need this because match of biometric data is not a byte to byte equal operation have many other things to care as I told before.

"49640987","Using Public/Private key pair as proof of delivery","The problem
I'm working on a mobile application where user A should physically delivery something to user B, and the user A MUST prove that delivered it.
There is a restriction:

User A or User B might be offline on the delivery, so it can not rely on internet connection

My approach
I thought about using cryptography to solve this problem:
When the delivery is scheduled, the following process occurs:

A key-pair is generated, and stored on database.
The private key belongs to User B and should be transfere to his mobile app.
Some well-known+delivery_uuid string is encrypted using the public key, and transferred to the User A.
User A is oriented to only show the encrypted code (in form of a QRCode) if the delivery occurs.
User B is oriented to read the QRCode using the mobile app when delivering.
Since the encrypted message begins with a well-known string, the User B mobile app can decrypt it and verify that the message is OK. The application store the delivery_uuid part if valid, and sends to server-side to keep track as soon as user get internet access.
If the User B try to fake the delivery_uuid, it will obviously not match.
If the User A try to fake the QRCode, the User B's app will not be able to validate the message.

Concerns

The fact of a well-known piece be present on every encrypted message can make it weaker? Considering that the key-pair is used just once.
The public key should NOT be visible to anyone. Only the back-end must use it to create the delivery proof message. Same obviously apply to the delivery_uuid
Sh*t happens. If the user B mobile app somehow crashes and loose the delivery_uuid before sending it to back-end, the user B will need to rely on user A honesty.
How strong must my keys be? Considering the monetary value of the package is low. Is RSA the better encryptation in this case?

I really know that this question is complex, but I really appreciate if someone can help-me with it.
Note: I'm not sure that Stackoverflow is the right stackexchange community to ask about this, please comment if it's offtopic. But since it have something about logic, I think that's the right place.
","Seems a little complicated. Why not

UserB (and every user who installs the app to receive deliveries) is issued a public/private key pair. The private key is held only by UserB; if it is lost, a new pair can be issued. Meanwhile, the public key is public, and is stored in a database along with UserB's identity. 
Upon receipt of the delivery, UserB generates a simple text document containing the date and time, the QRCode, the name of the person receiving the package, or whatever information is needed. The document also contains the public key. Any format will do.
UserB signs the document with his private key and appends the signature to the end of the document. Now you have a cleartext document spelling out everything that happened, and proof that UserB agreed to it.
UserB shares the document with UserA, and/or uploads it anywhere that is needed, e.g. system of record. Both UserA and UserB can keep an offline copy.
If proof of delivery is ever needed, UserA just needs to produce the signed document.

I'm working on a mobile application where user A should physically delivery something to user B, and the user A MUST prove that delivered it.

","If I understand the problem correctly, there are three parties here :

The verifying party, which is your back-end.
The selling party, which is User A.
The buying party, which is User B.

Also I do not buy the idea that ""The public key should NOT be visible to anyone"". They are meant to be, that's why they are called public. 
Now, In order to make sure that the item was delivered 

By User A
To User B, 

We can have the following setup.

The verifying party ( i.e. the backend ) generates a token, associates it with the buyer, the seller, item and persists the info.
The verifying party encrypts the token with User A's ( seller ) public key. 
The verifying party encrypts the already encrypted token with User B's ( buyer ) public key.
The verifying party sends the double encrypted token along to User B. Since it has been encrypted with User B's public key, only User B can read it. 
User B decrypts the double encrypted token using his private key and saves the result in his device. The result is now encrypted with User A's public key, which means only User A can read it.
When User A comes to deliver the item, User B hands over the encrypted token as acknowledgement. This can be done via a QR code scan.
User A decrypts the encrypted token with his private key and keeps it in the device. 
Whenever it is feasible ( in terms of availability of internet ) to prove it to the back-end, User A encrypts the token with the backend's public key and sends it along to the back-end. 
The back-end decrypts the encrypted token with its private key and does a lookup in its persistence store, matches the buyer and the seller and completes the verification.

","Use signatures and not encryption.
0) The app, as distributed, contains the public portion of a keypair only the server knows.
1) Every user that installs the app generates a keypair, keeping the private key, and uploading the public key to a database.
2) When a delivery is scheduled, the server generates a delivery ID and creates a message containing:

The Delivery ID
The deliverer's (user A's) public key fingerprint.
The recipient's (user B's) public key fingerprint.

A will receive this message and signature prior to making delivery. B can, but need not receive it prior to delivery.
3) When A meets B, A can off-line transfer the message and signature to B. QR code would be difficult, depending on key size, but NFC would certainly work. B can verify the server signature and know that the message has not been falsified or tampered with. A can transfer his public key to B and B can verify its fingerprint via the signed message. A can prove he is who he says he is by creating a signature with the private key belonging to the public key that was just transferred and verified.
4) B can prove who he is by creating a signature with the public key matching the fingerprint in the delivery message. B would have to transfer his public key to A if A didn't already have it, and A can verify it matches the fingerprint stored in the message.
5) B can certify receipt by creating a signature on a message saying so (however you want to format that) and off-line delivering it to A. A can then present this to the server, which the server can verify because it has B's public key.

","Let's assume that:
- A has a key pair.
- B holds a delivery UUID.
The goal is to enable B to provide a proof that only A can provide. 
As previous answers this can be solved by digital signature. You should let B and A to enchange the necessary information. B should provide the delivery Id, and A must sign it. 

You need to hold the public keys of the partners.
You need to provide a way for the information exchange, bluetooth perhaps?

I believe that you may need more than this simple protocol.

","After reading the answers, I've formulated a solution to the problem. I'm posting it as answer to know from everyone comments about it validity.
First, let give names to the actors to simplify:

User A is the Seller
User B is the Buyer

The use case

The buyer decides to buy, and make the payment. Now he talk with the seller to combine the delivery.
After payment confirmed, the back-end generates an UUID , and associate it with that transaction_id. Let's call it delivery_uuid. By the business logic, only the buyer have access to it.
The buyer app requests the delivery_uuid to the back-end, which produce a message containing both the delivery_uuid and the transaction_id, then digitally sign this message. Lets call this delivery secret
The buyer app will keep this message in storage.
When both seller and buyer meet, and the buyer checks if the product is OK, then he gives the delivery secret, using a QRCode or NFC.
With the delivery secret in hands, the seller's app can check the delivery secret authenticity (using the application's public key), then store it to send to back-end as proof of delivery as soon as he have internet access.
Now that the back-end have the proof of delivery, the payment to the seller is made.

Considerations
Buyer signature to the message
I think that it's not necessary, since by the back-end conception, only the buyer have access to the delivery secret. If the delivery secret leaked, certainly I'm in a bigger trouble.
Seller signature to the message
Also not necessary, the only concern about the seller is that he needs to send the delivery secret to the back-end. If he loose the cellphone, that's not our problem. If the application crashes and the delivery secret is lost, then we have a problem.
Server signature
This signature allow the seller to make sure that the delivery secret

Belongs to the right transaction, preventing the the buyer to use an authentic delivery token from another transaction.
Have a valid delivery_uuid
Make sure that delivery secret is still valid (we may add a validity to it)

openssl pkcs12 -in cert_and_pvt_key.pfx -out cert_and_pvt_key.pem
then I have a PEM file with both certificate and private key, now, I want to get certificate file and private key file respectively, yes, I know cert_and_pvt_key.pem is in text format, we can copy the key part and cert part as we like, but, this is not elegant, I want something sophisticated, like openssl pkcs12, is there anything available?
","You can use the -nocerts and -nokeys option to openssl pkcs12 to only output the part you need.  Run openssl pkcs12 with each in turn:
openssl pkcs12 -in cert_and_pvt_key.pfx -nokeys -out cert.pem

then:
openssl pkcs12 -in cert_and_pvt_key.pfx -nocerts -out pvt_key.pem

If you haven't got access to the original PKCS#12 file, then it becomes a little more difficult.  The following should work:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert_and_pvt_key.pem | openssl pkcs12 -nokeys -out cert.pem

and:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert_and_pvt_key.pem | openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out pvt_key.pem

However, this asks for a pass-phrase when the the PKCS#12 is created and again when it attempts to split the file to certificate and keys.  OpenSSL provides the -nodes verb to disable this pass-phrase, but it doesn't seem to work with -export.  Therefore, it would fail in a script.
Otherwise, you're left with splitting the file with awk or similar.  There are plenty of examples on this site.

First, it's easier. The code is written, tested, reviewed, and maintained.
Second, it's safer. If you don't understand why messages need to be signed, what else might you be overlooking? Honestly, even TLS (SSL), which has had a lot of scrutiny, had a serious flaw in the renegotiation bug that was recently publicized. Even when you know what you are doing, designing a secure protocol is hard.
By the way, SSH and SSL compute a message authentication code for every protocol record so that a man-in-the-middle cannot tamper with the message content.

Questions are these: What  is the name of the above format? What is the best way to consume that format from a Java String with the intent of using it to encrypt data (to later be decrypted with the matching public key of course)?

In order to avoid read from file the server's keystore, load it and get the private key, I am doing all of that in a listener that implements ServletContextListener. In this way this is done only when the servlet is initialised (deployed).  
Once I get the private key I am storing it in the application's ServletContext. Do you think that is a good design decision?
Thanks in advance.
","Whatever solution you choose, you'll have the private key in memory at some time. So any cracker having access to the memory could find a way to get this private key. Loading it once and storing it in memory at startup looks like a good solution to me. Just make sure that the server is not easily accessible to malicious persons.

I'm doing this as I am of the understanding that anything signed with my PRIVATE key can be decrypted with my PUBLIC - such as this for verification?  Is this wrong?
I'm encrypting the hash with these methods:
                public static string EncryptText(string text, int keySize, string publicKey)
            {
                var encrypted = Encrypt(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text), keySize, publicKey);

                }
            }

but passing my PRIVATE KEY down instead of my PUBLIC KEY.
Then to verify the signature, I am using:
                public static string DecryptText(string privateKey, int keySize, string text)
            {
                var decrypted = Decrypt(Convert.FromBase64String(text), keySize, privateKey);
                return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decrypted);
            }

            public static byte[] Decrypt(byte[] data, int keySize, string publicAndPrivateKeyXml)

                if (data == null || data.Length == 0) throw new ArgumentException(""Data are empty"", ""data"");

                }
            }

but passing down my PUBLIC KEY rather than the PRIVATE KEY. At this point, I am getting an error ""Key does not exist"".
I'm presuming this is the case because the PRIVATE KEY contains the relevant key information for the PUBLIC KEY so it can decode this one-way.
How can I sign a block of text in this way that allows me to distribute a signature with it, that can be decrypted by anybody who knows my PUBLIC KEY?

As far as I can tell, this works since I'm able to create a SSLContext with it.  I'm having trouble recreating a KeyPair object in order to perform other operations with it. I've tried:
Path privateKeyPath = Paths.get(""root.key.pem"");
File privateKeyFile = new File( System.getProperty(""user.dir"") + File.separator + ""ue.key.pem"");
byte[] bytes = Files.readAllBytes(privateKeyPath);
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec ks = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(bytes);

PEMParser pemParser = new PEMParser(new FileReader(privateKeyFile));
PrivateKeyInfo privateKeyInfo = (PrivateKeyInfo) pemParser.readObject(); // ?????

I've seen other code like Read an encrypted private key with bouncycastle/spongycastle, where they do pemParser.readObject, the object is of type PEMEncryptedKeyPair, or they use the converter to getKeyPair(), but when I call readObject, my object is of type PrivateKeyInfo so I cannot call getKeyPair either.
Is there a step somewhere I'm missing in either the changing to PKCS8 key with the OpenSSL command, or in trying to reconstruct the KeyPair?  Thanks.

But if I use a wrong passphrase in password=password, I get the same error as you get. So double check that you use the correct passphrase.
The password argument of from_private_key_file is your private key passphrase, not your account password.

In general you should not even need any account password, if you use private key, so I'm not sure why you pass password in the connect call – but that's not the immediate issue now.

The condor service on the Win7 VM runs as the local system account, but jobs being executed actually run as the condor_usr[1|2] account.
I have a new requirement to sign the compiled executable.  I've imported the certificate with private key into the Current User\Personal key store in the Windows Certificate store.
Problem
If I'm logged into the Win7 VM (e.g. via remote desktop) as one of the condor_usr accounts, then compiles running as that account will successfully sign the executable, but compiles running as the other account will fail to sign the executable.  For example, if I'm logged in as condor_usr2, then compiles running under condor_usr2 will sign successfully and compiles running under condor_usr1 will fail to sign.  If I log out, both accounts fail to sign.
The specific error I receive is:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v15.0\OfficeTools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Office.targets(264,9): error MSB3482: An error occurred while signing: The system cannot find the file specified.

Turned on some audit logging and found the following log that occurred at the same time as a signing failure.

Goal
Sign the compiled executable successfully regardless of which account the compile is running as and without requiring a user to be logged in.
What I've Figured Out So Far

The code/project being compiled is a Visual Studio 2017 solution.
The signing method is ClickOnce manifest signing (an option in the VS2017 project).
When a compile job is started, the job logs in as condor_usr[1|2] using logon type 2 (interactive logon).
https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-logon-types.html


Things I've Tried
Unless otherwise noted, these actions had no effect and were reverted.

Adding the condor_usr accounts to the Cryptographic Operators group.
Importing the certificate w/ private key to the Local Computer\Personal key store.


Granting the Network Service account full control to the certificate/private key.
https://community.dynamics.com/nav/b/technicaltipsandtricksfordynamicsnav/posts/how-to-grant-access-to-the-certificate-s-private-key-to-the-service-account-for-microsoft-dynamics-nav-server

Using PsExec -h make.bat to obtain the account's elevated token.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec
I considered that User Account Control (UAC) may be preventing the system account and/or condor_usr account from accessing the certificate store (or private keys in the cert store), but UAC is already disabled on the Win7 VM.
I placed the original .pfx certificate file in the VS2017 solution and targeted it instead of the certificate in the key store.  This had no effect, which leads me to believe that the issue is some sort of signing permission rather than (or perhaps in addition to) purely permissions around the actual certificate store.
I tried starting a job while logged in via remote desktop, and then logging out of the remote desktop session (actual logout, not disconnect) before the job got to the signing portion.  Signing failed.

","Make sure all the accounts involved in the process has the ""Logon as service"" rights by ensuring they are present in the local policy ""Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Log on as a service"". Note that this change becomes effective the next time the owner of the account(s) logs on.
Try running the HTCondor service directly as ""condor_usr1"" instead of the ""Local System"" account.

"6839331","What difference does key length make when signing a file?","I've never taken any classes on encryption or security and I'm trying to teach myself some basics, so forgive me if this is a silly question (don't worry, I'm not working on anything sensitive)
So, I'm playing around with Crypto++ so that I can make a signature of a file to see if the file has been edited by someone other than me. The test application that comes with the library looks like it has options (rs and rv) that do exactly what I want to do in my own program (verify the integrity of the signature of a file). Of course, before doing that I need to generate a public and private key. When doing so with the test application's g option it asks me to specify the key length in bits. What difference does the key length make?
","The key length determines how hard it is for someone to break your cryptography. For digital signatures, that means how hard is it for someone to generate a fake signature.
For RSA a key length of 1024 bits is sufficient for non-sensitive information, but it should only be used for a few years and then replaced with a new key. 2048 bits is stronger and 4096 is stronger still.
For a naive brute-force attacker, adding a single bit to the key length doubles the amount of work they need to do to compromise your key. However, algorithms like RSA do not scale in this way: a 2048-bit RSA key is not 2^1024 times as hard to break as a 1024-bit key (unless the attacker is really stupid).
Generally public key algorithms (e.g. RSA) need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms (e.g. AES) because they rely on different mathematical properties.
For a good primer on cryptography you should check out Peter Gutmann's godzilla crypto tutorial. It's pretty readable and gives you a good overview of how crypto works in its various forms.

the private-key is perfectly fine. but still this command asking for password.
","In order to use ssh passwordless connection you need to place the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (id_rsa.pub is just an example could be anything you used durring generation) of the user@local_machine to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the some_user@remote_machine. 
Further if other issues exist then you should check /var/log/ for the error.
Edit1:
Based on comments (thanks to @Crazy) if you used passphrase durring creation of the key then you need to recreate the key without the passphrase.

"29948083","API Authentication Method - am I doing it correctly?","I'm incredibly new to building API authentication - so wanted to ensure I'm going about this the correct way as there could be major security flaws that I'm not aware of.
It's based on a secret/private key pair, where both the client and the server know the secret key, but it's obviously never passed along the wire.
Any feedback, insights or holes in this method would be greatly appreciated.

Step 1:

The client wants to make a request to the API, so asks for a nonce from the server - passing their public key.

Step 2:

The server lookups the users private key (using the provided public key) and hashes it (sha256) with a random 32 character string (the nonce).
The hashed nonce and public key are then stored to a local array.
The server then responds to the client with the un-hashed version of the nonce.

Step 3:

The client takes the nonce from the response and also hashes it with it's private key (which the client has locally).
It then makes a request to the server (along with the API task it wants to perform) and sends its version of the hashed nonce and public key. 

Step 4:

The server takes the clients public key and hashed nonce, then checks the local array to see if the public key/nonce pair exist.
If the pair exist; authentication is passed, the request is allowed and the public key/nonce pair is removed from the local array.
","Let me start by saying I don't have any credentials in the security world. Please take everything I say with a grain of salt.
A couple of general thoughts
It seems like you want to roll your own which is a bad idea in any security-related area. Even more so when there are several alternatives in the wild that have been battle-tested.
Off the top of my head, I can name three ways for API authentication that are in wide use:

Basic authentication. Github provides this as a fall-back: “intended to be used for scripts or testing (i.e., cases where full OAuth would be overkill).”
OAuth. Github, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google all use this. This protocol is well-specified but might be overkill for smaller projects. Thanks to widespread client library, it's fairly easy to implement.
Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). All Amazon Webservices use this. This might be the most under-appreciated solution since it's conceptually easier than OAuth: The client uses its private key to sign requests and send the signature + public key in the request. The server looks up the private key using the public key sent by the client and in turn creates a signature of the request. If the signatures match, the request is valid. Public and private keys have to be exchanged beforehand (AWS lets you download the private key once).

From what you describe, HMAC is the closest candidate to what you want.
A couple of thoughts specific to what you suggested

Your algorithm requires you to keep state on the server (cue “local array”). This is fine for a single server, but what do you do when you scale? When step #2 hits one server and step #3 another, the state has to be shared. You can of course use a shared DB (or cache) or whatever, but you have to think about this.
Roundtrips. Requiring a 2-step authentication like you suggested, every client has to either send an additional request (to get the nonce) for each (payload) request or you have think about when to invalidate your pairs on the server. HMAC essentially does the same thing without request overhead.
Possible attack: I can flood your servers with client requests for nonces. Depending on your public key length, I might come up with valid public keys and I can tie up resources that are never used for the second request. Depending on how you handle that (see also point #1), I might bring your server down.

"20396172","Obtain Private Key from inside app","Is there any way to get the private key that current APK was signed with?
The operation is completely safe, since any modification (injection) to app would need a new signing and new key pair. So if private key (that developer is aware of that) is accessible to the running code, it's only accessible to the original code not a malicious one.
X509Certificate allows access to PublicKey, but I need access to PrivateKey.
public static X509Certificate GetCertificate(Context context) {

    PackageManager pm = context.getPackageManager();
    String packageName = context.getPackageName();
    PackageInfo packageInfo = null;
    try {
        packageInfo = pm.getPackageInfo(packageName, PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);
    } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    Signature[] signatures = packageInfo.signatures;

    byte[] cert = signatures[0].toByteArray();

    InputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(cert);


    CertificateFactory cf = null;
    try {
        cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X509"");
    } catch(CertificateException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    X509Certificate c = null;

    try {
        c  = (X509Certificate) cf.generateCertificate(input);
    } catch(CertificateException e) {

    }

    return c;
}

Edit:
A side question can be:
Is there any way to ensure that currently running code is running inside the APK with the original certificate? 
(Everybody have access to public key, so it's not a good candidate to check against, but private key is only known by original developer which can protect it (in some way) and check package certification against that.)
","The private key is used only for signing the APK and never (in theory) leaves the place of signing. So it's not possible to recover it from the APK. 
Update: and no, the code itself can't check the validity of its own image. If the image has been altered, it's trivial to remove the check as well.

Make it so each time the file is downloaded, a random string is appended. The file is then encrypted with the user's public key, and symmetrically with an appropriate hash generated by that same string. For example a GPG file inside a password-protected ZIP file.
So Alice downloads Financial_Report_201809_d8a1b2e6.pdf.zip while Bob downloads Financial_Report_201809_ff2a91c3.pdf.zip.
If they want to decrypt the file, they need to send the server back the random string, and the server will supply them with the password for the outer ZIP. Then they're left with an encrypted file that only their private key can decode.
Note that once they have decrypted the file, nothing stops them from forwarding the file in the clear to someone else. On the other hand, sharing the encrypted PDF avails them nothing, as they would also need to share their private key.
Also note that since they need to be online to get the outer password, and they're left with a cleartext file at the end, this is (almost) functionally equivalent to the file being downloaded in the clear once user identity has been established.
The main differences are:

the ciphered file (PDF in the above example) might not have been encrypted by the server at all. It might have been supplied by the user, who is then satisfied that only he can read the file back (it makes little sense for anyone else to download it, though).
the transmitted file is very securely transmitted. An attacker with full access to the datastream would not be able to decode the file (but this is no more than could be gained by just encrypting with the user's public key - no extra ZIP stage required).

UPDATE
You want to encrypt the whole file only once (for all users), and then send the same file to Alice and Bob, and have them require two different keys at decryption time. The problem here is that Alice's key will also work on Bob's file, since it is the same file. There's no magic that's going to work here, unless you can hide some detail of the decryption process (e.g. use a program that you control and that can't be debugged and that will always connect to your server: a proposition that has consistently shown to be losing).
If you want to limit the encryption cost, you can send the massive file with both a symmetrically encrypted data payload (always the same) and a very short, asymmetrically encrypted key payload (always different), but still you will be vulnerable to the decrypted key being captured:
[ RSA(ALICE.PUB, ""SQUEAMISH OSSIFRAGE"" ][ RIJNDAEL(""SQUEAMISH OSSIFRAGE"", LARGE FILE) ]

In the above scenario some program has to read the encryption header and decrypt the 'Squeamish Ossifrage' password, then go on decrypting (e.g. playing) the extra payload without the password being intercepted. This means that you need to supply the program yourself.
This is functionally equivalent to the program connecting to the server and downloading a ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question (appropriately encrypted, signed and secured) ""I am Alice's player. Can I decrypt and play 'Never Wanna Give You Up.avi'?"" , with no passwords or public keys being known or exchanged apart from the secret shared by Alice's player and the server.
UPDATE II
If the goal is to save encryption resources, the encryption could be made client side as hinted in the comment:

the file is encrypted the once, with a purpose-generated private key.
the private key is stored inside a binary (we must assume it to be unhackable).
the user has to supply his public key for the decryption to work
the program can verify the public key from a repository (or, alternately, the user can supply the public key to the server, which will generate and send the binary file for download)
the program then runs both the decryption and reencryption
the user is left with a file encrypted with his public key, that he alone can decrypt.

UPDATE III
In order for the cleartext file to never be exposed (i.e., it does not matter whether the algorithm gets leaked), you could devise the following scheme. Keep in mind that I'm not a cryptographer and there could be all sort of side channels left uncovered.

You prepare a conversion table that maps each 16-bit word into another 16-bit word. This is a flavour of symmetrical encryption, even if you use two reciprocal matrices for encoding and decoding. Each matrix holds all possible 16-bit words, which means 65536 values, and is therefore 128 Kb in size.
You encrypt the file, once, with the encryption matrix. Without the decryption matrix, the file is unusable.
The user has to send you his public key.
You prepare a transmogrification matrix by encrypting each word with that key, and use the decryption value as an index.

So, for example, say the first word of the cleartext file is A18B. In the encryption matrix, after the scramble, the A18B-th position will contain say 701C, and the decryption matrix, therefore, in the 701Cth position, will hold a18b.
The user has a file starting with 701c... which is of no use.
The user sends you his public key and you run 65536 encryptions on all words from 0000 to ffff. You then determine that the encryption of a18b is 791c. You prepare a re-encoding matrix that has 791c in the 701cth position.
You then send the user this matrix, which has 128K bytes, where the 701cth position is 791c.
The user runs the transmogrification, which is very fast, and is left with a file starting with 791c (as the 701c became 791c - I mistakenly chose two similar values in my example, that is of no significance). This value, once decrypted with his private key, will yield a18b which is the ""readable"" value.
The user has now a file that's been encrypted by his public key. The a18b value never appeared anywhere.
All that's left is for the user to decrypt the file using his private key and a code block size of 16 bits. This operation will be run by the client and be quite slow, and it's the reason why usually a large random quick symmetric key is RSA-encoded, and used to symmetrically quickly encrypt the large file, which can be quickly decrypted after the private key has unlocked the symmetric key.
The user cannot send the 128K to anyone, for they're useless without the private key.
(The problem here is still that the user can now decrypt the file with his private key, and send it around, even if it's unwieldy as it's a very large file).

Yes

but don't understand why the first process does not works and why adding the key to the agent make a difference.

The key is on your machine. If you do not add it to the agent and do not forward this agent to the hostA (probably specified in configuration?), it will not see the key and will not be able to authenticate you.

Can someone explain what was required for key forward that is satisfied by ssh-add, wasn't clear from available public documents.

Use ssh-add -l. It will list the keys you have in your agent. At first it does not list your key, after ssh-add it does. You should be able to run the same command on the hostA, where you should see the same key forwarded from your local machine.

Am I missing something obvious here?  originally gave him a CSR generated normally without the -subj argument (filled in using ubuntu terminal) but he says the inclusion of the ""ST"" abbreviation is causing a rejection from his CA. The state argument has to be ""S"". I don't work with SSL very often so Google has not really been helpful in telling me where to look.
","Look at man req (from openssl) and specifically the example at end:
    [ req_distinguished_name ]

    emailAddress           = test@email.address

The short version of stateOrProvinceName is ST not S.
I do not know where ""but he says the inclusion of the ""ST"" abbreviation is causing a rejection from his CA."" comes from, but that is certainly wrong, and you should get the actual error from the CA directly.
The reference is the X.520 standard, you can download it from https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.520-201610-I!!PDF-E&type=items
In it you can see:
stateOrProvinceName ATTRIBUTE ::= {
SUBTYPE OF  name
WITH SYNTAX UnboundedDirectoryString
LDAP-SYNTAX directoryString.&id
LDAP-NAME   {""st""}
ID.         id-at-stateOrProvinceName }

You can clearly see that the abbreviation is ""st"" and not ""s"".
It is impossible for a public CA to do things otherwise.

"34994926","Are hashes and MACs vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks?","Suppose there is an encrypted communication between A and B, through an unsecure medium, such that A and B shared a secret key with DH protocol.
If A sends an encrypted message and the hash/MAC/HMAC of this message to B, wouldn't it be easy for an eavesdropper to just intercept the hash/MAC/HMAC, change some bits in it, and send it to B?
B wouldn't be able to check the integrity of all messages sent by A and thus will destroy them everytime he gets a message from A, right?
B will then become non available ???
Thank you
","The process you describe is just a very specific form of corrupting the data. If an attacker can corrupt the data, then of course the attacker can prevent A from speaking to B. The attacker could just drop the packets on the ground. That would also prevent A from speaking to B.
Any data corruption, not just modifying the HMAC, will cause this same situation. If I modify the authenticated stream, then the (unmodified) HMAC won't match and it will be discarded.
The point of an HMAC is to ensure integrity. It has nothing to do with availability. Any Man-in-the-Middle can always trivially destroy availability in any system as long as the connection goes through them. (If they can't, they're not a MitM.)

"31596663","How is the process of signing and verifying a release and why apache says that the signature file signed by a public key?","I have started learning GPG and I am a bit confused about the infos I have found. The GnuPG documentation says that

A signature is created using the private key of the signer

But at the Apache's site, they say:

The signature file is a digest of the original file signed by a public key...

And on the same site, in another section, they say the following:

A digital signature is created from an original document using a private key.

Now I suppose that the process of signing involves signing the hash of a release using the private key of the holder and not the public one like Apache says in the second link I have posted, or am I wrong? Otherwise, how could someone be ever able to decrypt the hash of a release signed with a public key if he/she doesn't have the private key of the holder? 
Then, could someone simply explain in what the processes of signing and verifying a signature consist and what are the passages, e.g. for a software release like Apache Maven?
","TL;DR: There is a mistake in the documentation, your understanding of signatures is right.

The signature file is a digest of the original file signed by a public [sic, this is should be private] key...

Signing a document usually is performed by calculating the hash sum of the document (asymmetric cryptography is very slow for large amounts of data), which finally is encrypted using the private key, so anybody can decrypt it using the public key. If the decryption process results in the same hash sum as is calculated from the original document, it must have been encrypted using the private key - which is only known to the signer; thus the authorship is verified.
Encryption (leaving apart the aspect of hybrid cryptosystems like OpenPGP is, but the general concept stays the same) works the other way round; the public key is used for encryption, so only the private key can be used to decrypt the information.
I added a bug report for the documentation issue (closed/fixed since 2015-07-29).

Then, could someone simply explain in what the processes of signing and verifying a signature consist and what are the passages?, e.g. for a software release like Apache Maven -> https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp://apache.mirrors.tds.net/pub/apache.org/ ?


You need to fetch the public key used for signing the software (usually, you will download it from a keyserver using gpg --recv-key [key-id].
Verify the key's integrity, for example by speaking with the developers, your web of trust, the products HTTPs-encrypted website (depending on how paranoid you're at verifying the authorship).
Issue a signature to certify the key if it is not already verified through your web of trust, if you don't want to create a public one, there are also local signatures which are never transmitted to the key server network.
Finally, use gpg --verify to check that the signature was indeed issued by the product maintainer's key.

","What you initially refer to is symmetric encryption (shared key), which allows 2 entities to communicate securely based on a single shared key that is only known to the two entities.  This key can be exchanged several ways, but can't be publicized for obvious reasons.
Asymmetric encryption (public/private key) allows 2 entities to communicate securely as follows:
If one party wants to accept secure (encrypted) information, they need a key that isn't visible to the world (private), but they also have to be able to provide a key to anyone who wants to send encrypted information (public).
So I can give my public key out to the whole world and know the data is secure since only I have the private key, therefore I'm the only one who can decrypt it.

"33479597","Private and public key separately","οκ!I want to establish a client server communication oves SSL/TLS in java. The server is multithreaded. With openssl I acted as my own CA (created private key and self-signed certificate for the authority). Now I want to create keys and certs for my server and clients which are signed from the CA I created.
1)Do I have to create certs and keys from the prompt for every single client? Or is it another ""automated"" way eg with a script?
2) I have seen that this code for setting up keystores
private void setupClientKeyStore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException 
    {
    clientKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    clientKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream( ""client1publickey.jks"" ),
                       ""password"".toCharArray() );
    }

    private void setupServerKeystore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException
    {
    InputStream keyStoreResource = new FileInputStream(""serverprivatekey.jks"");
    char[] keyStorePassphrase = ""password"".toCharArray();
    serverKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(""JKS"");
    serverKeyStore.load(keyStoreResource, keyStorePassphrase);
}

I have run the command to see what type of entries are these and client1publickey is a TrustedCert entry while serverprivatekey is a PrivateKey entry. This code is on my server class. I have this code on my client class  private void setupServerKeystore() throws GeneralSecurityException, IOException {
    serverKeyStore = KeyStore.getInstance( ""JKS"" );
    serverKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream(""serverpublickwy.jks""), 
                        ""university"".toCharArray() );
  }

    clientKeyStore.load( new FileInputStream( ""client1privatekey.jks"" ),
                       ""university"".toCharArray() );}
The question is that how can I create these jks files separately? The publickey.jks file is cert, right? How can I have it in another file from the private key and be signed from CA? Or is it another way I can estabvlish connections between client/server? 
Firstly I had created the CA with openssl and then the two jks files for server and client included the certs and the key. Sorry for the english.

So I have to opt for asymmetric key encryption. assuming I've two components A and B A sends some data F to B and B has to verify that it really came from A
A generates digest H of F with its private Key
A attaches A_pub, H to its request Parameters, sends F and declares origin/sender as A 
B verifies the digest H with the A_pub provided against F
apparently it looks Okay But if some other component V does the same with V_pub and claims itself as A, B still thinks the request came from A as this H is made with V_prv openssl verifies Okay.
I want to give protection against this attack of V
I am using ecparam secp112r1 to minimize key length. and keys are repeatedly changed.
-- EDIT --
A, B and V are application components identified by unique URI. Its currently intended to constraint secure page flow. e.g. you can assume A, B, V be urls What I want is Only A can procced to B and only B can proceed to C .... and I don't want to maintain a global/application wide session for that. so If B can just verify the origin of this link based on the special parameters A have passed to it in a state/session-less manner. and the more generic it can be the more reusable it will be to implement in other scenarios too.
Once I thought to maintain a checksums of A_pub in a trusted global storage. however I am afraid wouldn't that be an over engineering ?
another way comes in my mind is to query back the origin url regarding the public key. However I want to avoid that.
","This technique cannot verify the identity of the sender, only that the keys are a matching pair.  
Typically, B would already possess some piece of trusted information that it can use to validate A's identity.  The information is generally a copy of A_pub that it had previously validated, or that has been signed by a trusted third party, in which case B must have access to that third party's public key.
Without this additional information, B cannot verify the identity of A.

Our client just gave us their private key and they will access our Web API with SSL Client Certificate which included their private key in PEM format.

The first step is to parse the text with PEM_read_bio which will strip off the PEM header and base64-decode the data. But it is unclear how to parse the struct from the spec.
The first 15 bytes are fixed as openssh-key-v1\0 but from there it is unclear.
","The simplest way to parse these is to avoid parsing them yourself, and instead use ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa to convert the key into PEM format, and then parse that using OpenSSL as per normal.
If you have a serious desire to get your hands dirty, though, the protocol description you linked to does, in fact, give you most of what you need to know.  The (crucial) pieces of missing information are:

All integers are network byte order;
int is 32 bits;
Most crucially, the string type is a length-value tuple, where length is a uint32 indicating how many of the next octets make up the string; and
The formats of the various public key types (ssh-dss, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-*, etc) are documented in various RFCs that you can find referenced in the IANA registry for SSH Public Key Algorithm Names.

Extrapolation of the private key portions of various key types is left as an exercise for the reader, because I haven't figured it out yet.  In the (near) future, my openssl-additions gem will have a Ruby-based implementation of SSH private key parsing, because I need to figure it out for my own project, so you could take the parameter ordering from that.

I add a development signing key to the projects repository so that anyone can build and use those libraries from source, but for the official release, I use a different key, one that I do not publish.
Question is this:
Should I

Use a common key for all official releases I make of all my libraries? ie. library A and B would both be signed by the same private key, even though the libraries have nothing in common except the author (me)
Use a unique key for all libraries, ie. library A has its own key and library B has a different key

I'm looking for definite reasons to do one or the other. If you have an opinion but not a hard reason for why that is, please leave a comment and I'll see if I should migrate it to Programmers.SE instead.
","If you have many signatures people will doubt your identity. 
The key belongs to the publisher, not to any project/binary.

the libraries have nothing in common except the author 

Which is the deciding factor to use 1 key.
But that is the basic principle. If you want to express: This Project1.DLL is published by the Project1-Team you could use a key per library.  That would not add any value, but might be practical when you start to co-operate on projects with different sets of people.

","I think your question is quite loaded. You ask three different questions
1) How do I upload something to the server? Should I ask developer to modify it for that?
The answer is: The server should support accepting and storing a thing which you try to upload. If it's capable of that now, you don't need to server developer to add anything. If the server isn't capable, you will need to ask to provide some UI, API for this
2) How should I store securely P12 on my server
Do you want to protect this file against somebody who can legally access server or somebody who can hack the server?
P12 file is encrypted. So, it's not a matter of securely storing file itself, but rather who knows the password. So, the main question is should you upload the password, should only user know the password, should you upload hash of the password? It's hard to answer it without better understanding of what you are trying to do.
3) How to upload something to the server from Android?
I think  you may be interested to look at kSOAP (http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/). It allows you to work with the server.
However, since you need it once, may be just FTP upload of the file will be ok for you?
I would recommend to edit your questions and describe what is the overall problem you are trying to solve.

","RFC-5649 (Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap with Padding Algorithm) has been published to handle cases for which the key material is not a multiple of 64 bits.
BouncyCastle, a free Java library implementing many cryptographic algorithms, offers a wrap engine that supports the RFC-5649 key wrapping algorithm. Therefore, you may use this library to avoid the Java exception you encounter.
Note that what we commonly call an RSA
 key of 2048 bits, for instance, is not simply made of an array of 256 bytes. It is made of two prime numbers such that their product can be stored in a array of 256 bytes, it is also made of a private exponent that is lower than the aforementioned product. Depending on the way the private key material is stored in a file, some other public data may be encapsulated  in the file, such as the public exponent. So the private key material of an RSA key of 2048 bits may not be stored with 256 bytes.

The user of the game must guess the answer to the question, perform some encryption method using a public key, and if the answer they guessed when encrypted is the same as the encrypted answer then they got it right.
Here's the tricky part, when the user gets the right answer, they must also get the private key to decrypt the next question.   Is this possible or am I totally off base? 
Ps I know that keys must be random
","From my point of view 2 comments:

perform some encryption method using a public key, and if the answer they guessed when encrypted is the same as the encrypted answer then they got it right.

When you crypt something with a key (RSA) there are a part that is random so each time that you crypt a message can get a different value, so you have to check if there are in the library that you are going to use (openSSL?) to force this random part. 
You can use a hashing algorithm (MD5, SHA1) that is a common way to achieve your goal

when the user gets the right answer, they must also get the private key to decrypt the next question

I guess that you try that question are not accessible unless you answer the prior question right. So you need to keep a key as secret, so it must be crypted maybe you can use the answer as a key (depending of algorithm that you use to crypt)

","Best (in my opinion) you put the private key and certificate that you want to use on the keychain (or keychains of other 3rd party apps that share the same provisioning certificate). 
As for the actual loading of the p12 we do use openssl (we did write a obj-c wrapper around it) to decode the .p12 that we send to the app.

things tried :
The readDSAPrivateKey method of this link on github: https://github.com/bitsai/courses/blob/master/Network%20Security/A3/Honoroff-Tsai/src/DNSSEC.java

"56181924","CSSMERR_DL_DATASTORE_DOESNOT_EXIST while trying to import a private key to the keychain","With my application, I am trying to import a private key into the login keychain.
For this, I create a all the attributes in a dictionary. 
NSMutableDictionary *attributes = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[attributes setObject:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyTypeRSA
               forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyType];
[attributes setObject:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyClassPrivate
               forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeyClass];
[attributes setObject:[NSNumber numberWithLong:(2048)]
               forKey:(__bridge id)kSecAttrKeySizeInBits];

Then create a SecKeyRef for the key using 
SecKeyRef privateKey = SecKeyCreateFromData((CFDictionaryRef)attributes, (CFDataRef)encodedPrivateKeyData, &error);

Since I am adding the key to the login keychain, I derive the path to the login keychain and create a SecKeyChainRef for the same using SecKeychainOpen.
NSArray *path = [NSHomeDirectory() pathComponents];
//returns /Users/<username>/Library/...
NSString *keychainPath = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@%@/%@%@"",path[0],path[1],path[2],@""/Library/Keychains/login.keychain""];
SecKeychainRef keychain = NULL;
OSStatus status = SecKeychainOpen([keychainPath UTF8String],&keychain);

Once we have the privateKey as well as the keychainRef, we can actually create a representation of the privateKey using 
CFDataRef exportData = NULL;
status = SecItemExport(privateKey, kSecFormatWrappedPKCS8, 0, &keyParams, &exportData);

To finally add the privateKey that was stored in exportData, I use 
CFArrayRef outItems = NULL;
status = SecItemImport(exportData, NULL, &dataFormat, &actualType, 0, &keyParams, keychain, &outItems);

The problem occurs with the SecItemImport where I get an OSStatus of
-25294 errSecNoSuchKeychain - ""The specified keychain could not be found""
CSSM Error: Keychain Access CSSM Exception: -2147413737 CSSMERR_DL_DATASTORE_DOESNOT_EXIST 
The odd thing is that both the SecKeychainOpen and SecItemImport functions use the same SecKeychainRef of the login keychain, but the application can successfully find the keychain only during the SecKeychainOpen function. It fails only during the SecItemImport operation. Since it is the login keychain that has a lot of passwords saved, I'd like to figure out a solution without having to reset the keychain if possible. 
This is an isolated incident that I've only seen on one Mac and would like to figure out why this happens. Trying to research this issue, I came across threads that mention a ghosted keychain but I've confirmed that it's not the case this time.

Ideally you buy an HSM and store them there. I don't know if GAE has an HSM. AWS does but it's not cheap. 
You could also create a simple server with a very limited and locked down API and store your keys in it and get that server to sign stuff for you, without revealing your key.
Your next best option is to store your keys in a file or envar that can only be read by the user that your app is running as.

","Crypto++ uses the PCKS #8 Private Key Information Standard for private keys and the X.509 Public key standard format as specified in their documentation. Puttygen uses the PuTTY format. These are not easily converted using C++, but it is possible. It's a lot easier just to export to OpenSSH format from within puttygen though.
If you still want to do it programmatically, you can use the Chilkat CKSshKey library which was developed for just this purpose. You can see an example of converting a PuTTY private key to OpenSSH PEM (which is what Crypto++ will read) here.

I already can check for a WIF private key but I have no Idea how to represent anything that remotely looks like a private key (WIF, Extended Format/ECDSA, Mini, Parent Private Key) with Regex.
If you don't think Regex is the way to go, you can suggest something else to me, keep in mind that I don't need to verify that it actually exists and I don't need something overly complicated.
For checking for BIP 39 Seeds, I have a function below that slices the string list in turns of 12,18 and 24 and compares each slice to a string list of all 2048 words in BIP39 but it doesn't seem to work.
Code for checking for WIF looks like this and it works, the code has a larger part but I don't want to complicate things, just bringing out what is needed.
z = ""5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreAbuatmU""

Let's call it the Private Key server, or PK server for short. After receiving the private key, the .apk can be signed, and then the private key will be deleted.

What kind of implementation is required on the PK server to do this?
On the build server, what is needed in the Hudson build script to initiate the sending of the Android private key?

I assume this involves some sort of encryption protocol but I am unsure of how to implement it between these 2 systems.
","As you will be running this unattended in the CI server you will need a way of retrieving the keystore from your PK server without manually entering a password which will defeat your intention.
I would suggest you to keep the keystore in your PK server and create a service that takes an unsigned APK as argument and returns the signed APK. In this way your keystore never leaves the PK server.
This service can be invoked as a build step in your CI server.

Retrieve private key from the WAS Keystore (custom private key imported in WAS Console) in our java application to sign data.    Signed Data would be decrypted using the Public key which is been shared to the other applications. 
How we have done in our current (which is NOT working,  Unable to generate or convert the Key to PrivateKey ) 
We were retrieving the Websphere KeyPair Object with help of KeyHelper API and got the java.security.Key Object from the KeyPair. 
Link which we used to develop the code referring Knowledge Center 
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rsec_sslretgenkeysetgrp.html
Code Snippet : 
String keySetGroupName = ""CMODSSOKeySet"";
com.ibm.websphere.crypto.KeySetHelper ksh =     com.ibm.websphere.crypto.KeySetHelper.getInstance();
Map generationKeys = ksh.getAllKeysForKeySet(keySetGroupName);

Iterator iKeySet = generationKeys.keySet().iterator();

String keyAlias = (String)iKeySet.next();
Object keyObject = generationKeys.get(keyAlias);

Now after we got the keyObject as instance of com.ibm.websphere.crypto.KeyPair and when we retrieve the Private key from the keyObject as mentioned below we get java.security.Key Object but not the PrivateKey object. 
java.security.Key privateKeyAsSecret = ((com.ibm.websphere.crypto.KeyPair)key).getPrivateKey();

We need to convert privateKeyAsSecret to PrivateKey and we tried in different ways which doesnt work. 
Option 1 : 
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpecPKCS8 = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(Base64.decodeBase64(privateKeyContent.getEncoded()));
 PrivateKey privKey = kf.generatePrivate(keySpecPKCS8);

Option 2 : 
X509EncodedKeySpec keySpecPKCS8 = new X509EncodedKeySpec(Base64.decodeBase64(privateKeyAsSecret.getEncoded()));
PrivateKey tempPrivateKey = kf.generatePrivate(keySpecPKCS8);

Option 3 : 
PrivateKey tempPrivateKey = (PrivateKey) ((com.ibm.websphere.crypto.KeyPair) key).getPrivateKey();

Option 4 : 
String privateKeyContent = new String(privateKeyAsSecret.getEncoded());
privateKeyContent = privateKeyContent.replaceAll(""\\n"", """").replace(""-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----"", """").replace(""-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"", """");
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpecPKCS8 = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(privateKeyContent));

a hacker managed to capture amazon's public key

Amazon's public key is public. Everyone knows it. The one that was issued May 3, 2018 begins ""A9 F4 4A 9B 29 84 20 A7 53 FF BA 01 B5 1E 0C 2A A7 53"". The whole point of public/private key cryptography is that the public key is not a secret. So capturing the public key is not important.
Your question isn't about masquerading as Amazon to you (i.e. having to do with Amazon's keys). It's about masquerading as you to Amazon. That's a completely different situation. You don't identify yourself to Amazon with a certificate (called a ""client certificate""), so certificates and public/private key cryptography have nothing to do with this. Yes; anyone could send a message to Amazon encrypted with their public key, but that's not how you prove you are who you say you are.
Instead, you identify yourself to Amazon with credentials, typically a user name and a password. When you do that, Amazon hands you back a session token, which is just a big random number that is mapped to you in a database table (or sometimes the session token is encrypted information about the session so that the database isn't needed). Once you're authenticated, you keep passing your session token back to Amazon to say ""you already know and trust who I am.""
So what if someone captures the session token? That would be a big deal. That would absolutely allow exactly what you're describing. The session token has to be protected for as long as it's valid. We protect it when we pass it to Amazon using TLS which ""prevents sniffers from knowing the content of a message"" so attackers hopefully can't discover the session id.
There are many attacks to steal the session id, broadly called ""session hijacking."" One of the more famous was Firesheep, which relied on unsecured (HTTP) sessions. However, there are more advanced attacks against HTTPS, such as CRIME and BREACH. Improvements in TLS have mitigated against various known attacks, but it is always possible that new ones will emerge.

Very good question.  TLS prevents this by creating sessions keys between the client and server during the handshake protocol.  There are two types of keys: one for encryption (typically AES) and one for message integrity / message authentication (MAC) (typically HMAC).  All comms during the session are encrypted with the symmetric encryption key and MAC'ed with the MAC key.  Any data that is not properly signed with the MAC key is not accepted by the server.  Thus, only one who has these keys can communicate with the server for that session.
So the question then reduces to how an attacker can determine the encryption and MAC keys which are set up during the initial TLS handshake.  Note during the handshake, the server provides its public key via the certificate to the client, and the client verifies that the certificate is valid -- including that it belongs to the domain that is claimed in the certificate.  This allows the client to verify that it is talking to the right server assuming nobody can bypass PKI (i.e. cert authorities are doing the right thing and nobody can break the public key crypto).  Now different clients can set up different sessions with the server, but they all are done using a private key generated by each client and uniquely known by each client.  Therefore, each client sets up its session in a unique way using a key that is known only to them and nobody else.
There is more to the whole design if you want to dig deep, including how sequence numbers are used to prevent replay attacks.  But I hope you get the general idea.

"56237880","How to sign a xml document with a smartcard's private key using nodejs","I want to digitaly sign a xml document. The problem is that I can't do it in the server side, since the certificate is read from a smart card reader. When the smart card is inserted, we can also access the certificates through the windows certificates store. I thought of using the nodejs packages win-ca to access the certificates and the xml-crypto to sign my xml document with the correct syntax.
I'm able to access the user certificates with the following code:
const ca = require('win-ca')
certsPem = []

ca({
  format: ca.der2.pem,
  store: ""MY"",
  ondata: cert => certsPem.push(cert)
})

But I also need to access the private key. If I could export the private key to a file, all I needed to do to read it and sign the xml with it is:
var fs = require('fs')
var xml = fs.readFileSync(""xmlFile.xml"")
var key = fs.readFileSync(""privateKey.key"")

var SignedXml = require('xml-crypto').SignedXml
var sig = new SignedXml()
...
sig.signingKey = key
sig.computeSignature(xml)
...

But its impossible to export the private key from the smart card and store it in a file, the smart card simply doesn't allow it. Is there a way in nodejs for me to sign with the private key without having to read a private key from a file?

","The id_rsa.pub file contains the RSA public key for your user (generally the key used for connecting to GitHub, if you follow their tutorial).  If you want to use the github_rsa key, you can change the key used to connect to GitHub by creating a new host definition in the ~/.ssh/config file:
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa

By the way, the known-hosts file contains the servers you have connected to and their public keys.

","The known-host file that you have given in the question has the public ssh-keys of the respective servers.
The private-public key pair are supposed to be for authentication!
Your .ssh folder is supposed to have two keys 1. Private key and 2. Public key. Public key has extension .pub and private key dosen't have any! 
So most probably the two files that you have are one is Public (Which will also be there on github) and private.
Anyhow To know which key your github is using you can do this:

Find the public key in your github account and find its pair in your .ssh folder (i.e if you have maintained a proper nomenclature).
OR else Take your private key and run the command ssh-keygen -y -f <private key file>, it will create a public key. Compare the generated pub-key with your github!

Hope this explains a lot more than the question for your future use! :)

","I think in general your questions on performance are answered here. wikipedia : modular exponentiation
The article describes

Direct exponentiation
Memory efficient exponentiation
Binary exponentiation

Direct Exponentiation
raise to the power e and take the modulo.
This is straight forward, but the size of the number pre modulo is extermely large.
Memory efficient exponentiation
Replacing the power operation with a multiply e times, allows the accumulated result to always be within the modulo range.  This limits the size of the bignum and speeds up the operation.
Binary exponentiation
If you convert the power to a binary number 
if e = 13  => 1101
pow(n, 13) = pow( n, 8) * pow(n,4) * pow(n, 1)
So for an m bit exponent, then only about m operations need to be done.
Combining the memory efficient and binary exponentiation solves most of the performance.
Python offers an implementation of these improvements using the 3 argument power function e.g. 
>>> import timeit
>>> t = timeit.Timer( 'print(pow( 10,14918179, 15372757))' )
>>> t.timeit(1)
10140931
0.06365180000000237

>>> u = timeit.Timer( 'print(pow( 10,14918179) % 15372757)' )
>>> u.timeit(1)
10140931
15.021656000000007

The 3 parameter of pow takes .06s whilst the 2 parameter version of pow takes 15 seconds.

Certificates are installed manually via Local Machine Certificate Manager (certlm.msc) into a custom cert store, called ""Public Hub Interface"". The service has already been in production for several months now and, apart from the issue below, is running smoothly.
Although everything works fine under LocalSystem, to maximize security, I'm trying to use a virtual service account, such as ""NT Service\Public Hub Interface"". However, because the account is so heavily restricted, the service no longer has access to the system's private keys, which, consequently, causes AcquireCredentialsHandle to return SEC_E_UNKNOWN_CREDENTIALS. I've tried manually and programmatically granting access to various file and registry objects, as outlined in the following links, but with partial success - CAPI certificates work, but not CNG.

There are others, but they all pretty much say the same things. Additionally, many of the solutions work on individual certs and assume direct access to them or, at least, knowledge of their locations. Unfortunately, this isn't the case for me, as the certs are installed externally via certlm, and, a separate, custom cert installation app is not in the game plan. Indeed, I'm more interested in accessing the containers, as opposed to working on their specific contents, if possible. Furthermore, there are many certs, of which none are known ahead of time and most are usually installed well after the service is in operation.
I'd rather not switch from the local machine's store provider to the service's (i.e. current user's) store provider, especially since I'm very close to release and don't have the time to modify/retest already working code, let alone re-import the certs as well as retrain operators on a new procedure. As such, I'm hoping there's a simple and reliable way to grant the service the same access to the system private keys that the LocalSystem account has.
Please note that the service is installed via a MSI package that uses an unmanaged C++ custom action DLL to perform advanced operations, such as configuring service recovery options and creating the cert store; I'm planning on using this same DLL to set up the required access during installation. That said, I'd prefer a programmatic solution to one that uses an external program (e.g. WinHttpCertCfg.exe or CertUtil.exe), which might not even work on the target system, or, would have to be included in the package if it doesn't yet exist.
Many thanks for any assistance.

when you copy the public key in your GitLab settings profile, it is copied as one line
when you generate your RSA SSH key, you use the old legacy profile (in case the new OPENSSH one with 70 chars per line is not well interpreted)

The SunMSCAPI provider enables applications to use the standard JCA/JCE APIs to access the native cryptographic libraries, certificates stores and key containers on the Microsoft Windows platform. The SunMSCAPI provider itself does not contain cryptographic functionality, it is simply a conduit between the Java environment and the native cryptographic services on Windows.

The WINDOWS-MY keystore in SunMSCAPI uses the standard Java KeyStore API, and it does not define any type of ""extractable"" property, so I'm afraid you will not be able to establish it.

If not, how does it prevent others from tampering the response message?
","I think I can answer my question by myself. The server will encrypt the response with public-key and send it to client. Other than that, the server will send a checksum as well, which acts as the signature. The checksum is generated based on the private-key that only server knows, therefore it is hard for others to fabricate it. Thus, if anyone trying tampering the message, it won't match the checksum.

I have to obtain example - csr.pem from example.csr. How it can be done?
","OpenSSL creates CSRs in PEM format by default.
If you generated the CSR without the -outform option, the CSR will already be in PEM format.
If you did use the -outform DER option, you can convert with:

","You could retrieve and compare the fingerprints of the public keys included in the apk file and your key file.
For the apk:

Unpack the file /META-INF/CERT.RSA from the apk.
Use keytool -printcert -file CERT.RSA to compute the SHA1 + MD5 fingerprints.

For the key file:

Run keytool -list -v -keystore <keystore file> -alias <key alias>.
Input your keystore password.
This will output the SHA1 + MD5 fingerprints. If you omit the -v only the MD5 fingerprint will be printed.

I decided to use the "".profile"" and "".bashrc"" files and to reload the "".bashrc"" file towards the end of the task happening during the first login. 
During the first login, I create a private key and certificate signing request, and call an API to get the certificate. I store this certificate and private key in a file location and then modify the "".bashrc"" to invoke the second set of files, which make use of this certificate and key to authenticate an application to run.
The problem is that the certificate and key are overwritten and become null randomly after the first boot. I've attached the code below for your review.

Problem
Even thought the first set of files create the key and certificate, they are overwritten to NULL after the first reboot.
To make sure that they exist before reboot, I go to the location ""/anotherFolder"" and check the files physically. They have the full key and certificate before reboot. When I reboot and see that the script fails, the same key and certificate files (which had actual data before reboot) now have NULL values.

","James K Polk pointed me into the right direction.
I had to Normalize the point first (""pub_key_1 =pub_key_1.Normalize()"") before I could obtain the coordinates.
I changed the code accordingly and now it gives me the correct results.

Now i want to set cookie, details are given below:

I will create a cookie with http only
Next i will use private and public key concept, public key will be encoded and added to cookie Values with a time stamp and username all encoded.
I think i will encode like below:
private static byte[] GenerateDigitalSignature(byte[] data,RSAParameters asymmetricKey)
{
    using (var rcsp = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    using (var cp = new SHA1CryptoServiceProvider())
    {
        rcsp.ImportParameters(asymmetricKey);

        return rcsp.SignData(data, cp);
    }
}

And then upon login request i will decode it using the Private key and if the user is Authorize then i will allow the user to show the page.
Right Now i am thinking to put my private and public key in web.config.

Can you please guide me is this correct implementation for login and setting cookie.
Also can you put an example to set cookie with three parameters viz. Public key, Datetime and UserName and decode it using private key
I am setting my cookie like below:
System.Web.HttpCookie loginCookie1 = new System.Web.HttpCookie(""loginCookie"");
    Response.Cookies[""loginCookie1""].Values = new Dictionary<String, String>()
                        {

 1. Receive data and store it encrypted data with public key
 2. Private key is not supplied and not stored
 3. Return encrypted data through the APIs
 4. Display decrypted data in the web client with the private key supplied (but never sent over the wire)

Is this standard mode of operation?
I was thinking the client would supply the private key on demand and it will be stored in memory, so every new session the key would need to be supplied again. that way the client can decrypt these fields to display.
Any better suggestion on how to handle customer sensitive data, where only the customer can see that decrupted data, and not even the admin on our service can decrypt the data?

","Encrypt the data on the client and send the encrypted data to the server. This eliminate the need for the server to have a public key per client. Since only the client has the key a symmetric key algorithm such as AES is a better solution.
Generally even when using PKI the data is actually encrypted with a symmetric key. Asymmetric key encryption has several limitations such as being exceptionally slow and limited in data size to the key size. There needs to be a compelling reason to need a public/private key pair.

javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: Handshake message sequence violation, 2

Not sure what is the wrong and if I am missing any encode/decode etc..
I get PKCS#1 private key as String input and I have to use bouncy castle to convert to PKCS#8 and generate privatekey and add to store.
Note: private key is content of client_private.key
","(Not an answer but too much for comments.)

where the content of client.csr is provided as public key string  ...

The CSR is not a public key, it is a CSR. But the code you show clearly doesn't use it. It does apparently use the certificate, which also is not a public key, it is a certficate -- which contains a public key. However, a certificate, and NOT a public key OR a CSR, is the correct thing to use for SSL/TLS authentication.

I get PKCS#1 private key as String input and I have to use bouncy castle to convert to PKCS#8 and generate privatekey and add to store ....

You don't actually need to convert to PKCS8; PEMParser plus JcaPEMKeyConvertor can convert PKCS1 directly to a KeyPair containing a usable (RSA)PrivateKey, which is much simpler. Or OpenSSL can easily create PKCS8 key which standard JCE (without BouncyCastle) can read -- or for that matter PKCS12 which is already a Java keystore without any conversion of any kind. But what you have does work.

Now I have to create java keystore, add these keys and export as JKS file pragmatically. 

Aside: you probably mean programmatically, not pragmatically. Your code doesn't export any keystore file, and doesn't need to; and you don't need to use a JKS keystore specifically, any supported in-memory keystore should work, although you don't show the code doing the connection and using the keystore. Starting with Java 9 (almost two years ago) Oracle recommends people stop using JKS and use PKCS12 instead, although I doubt they will actually drop JKS anytime soon.

javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: Handshake message sequence violation, 2

That's your actual problem, and it's not the keystore, or key, and shouldn't be the cert. Even if you are sending a key and cert it doesn't like, the server should respond by rejecting the authentication within the protocol(s), not violating protocol. And 2 is ServerHello, which should occur only before the certificate is sent or checked in either direction. Do at least one of the following:

standard Java SSL/TLS debugging: run with sysprop javax.net.debug=ssl,handshake and capture/log the output. (Below Java 11 you can actually use just ssl and it automatically includes handshake.) This will show exactly what your system is sending and receiving, and allow determining how it is wrong, which should at least help determine why.
capture the handshake with a network trace like wireshark, tcpdump, or similar, and look at it. This works even if there is something seriously wrong in Java (which there shouldn't be) but is at least a little harder to decode, and if you aren't quite careful risks including other data on the network during the same time period that may be sensitive and unshareable. 
try to connect with another tool (or tools), using the same key+cert and from the same machine if at all possible -- this might be a network-related problem that depends on where you connect from. Since you have openssl and already have the files in OpenSSL formats, simplest is to use
openssl s_client -connect $host:$port -key keyfile -cert certfile [see text]
s_client is also unusual (unique AFAIK) in that you can control whether or not SNI (the Server Name Indication extension) is sent, and with many servers nowadays that may well affect the server's behavior (possibly triggering or suppressing a bug). Whether Java (JSSE) sends SNI depends on a combination of usually several factors you did not tell us: always the version of Java, and usually some details of the code making the connection attempt, especially whether it uses HttpsURLConnection, the new-j11+ HttpClient, third-party code like Apache or google, or custom code. For OpenSSL releases through 1.1.0, SNI is not sent by default and you must add -servername $host to send it. For 1.1.1, it is sent by default but is not sent if you add -noservername. 
In this example I did not specify a truststore. s_client by default will verify against its default truststore, which may or may be correct for your server, but will ignore any error and proceed anyway. If you were debugging a certificate trust problem then it would be important to match OpenSSL's truststore with the one used by your Java, but not for your problem.
check with the server operator(s) how this problem is perceived at their end: do they think there is something wrong with your handshake, and if so what? What software (or usually more relevant middleware) are they running, with what config or options? 

If you add (some/enough of) this information to your Q, I will try to update this to be an actual answer.

","Of course, you can use only one key for each message and we called this forward security. To achieve this you need to use a key exchange protocol as Diffie-Hellman Key exchange protocol. This will increase communication, but security is not cheap and it is used in TLS 1.3 
With forward secrecy, even successful attacks in of the parties, the attacker can at most access the current key if there is an encryption operation. The previous keys are not stored once the message was sent so there is no key compromise.

I understand there would a tremendous need for syncing between user's keys, but this is just a hypothesis I am thinking of.

","It is well possible, but feasibility may depend on how you use your keys.
As already answered - ephemeral (one-time temporary) keys are used in TLS for achieving forward-secrecy in the key-excange to derive symmetric session encryption keys. So it's not really a new keypair for every message, but rather for establishig a session. Generating a new good key may needs some performance and time.
Even so your app needs to maintain a long-time key to sign the ephemeral public key to ensure integrity so the recceiving party can be sure the ephemeral keys are really from party it claims to be. That is as well part of te TLS key exchange.
If you are not using direct (session) communication, but sending the messages asynchronously, I see no point to generate a new keypair. You can just create a new random encryption key (assuming hybrid encryption). To ensure integrity the message needs to be signed by the sender as well, so a long-lived persistent key is necessary.

","For encryption, the message receiver could generate a new public/private key pair and send the public key to the message sender.  The sender could then encrypt using this public key.  This decreases the risk due to a compromised key pair.  You lose just one message if the ephemeral key is compromised instead of all of them if a long-term key is compromised.
However, encrypting alone does not provide security.  You also need to authenticate the sender and receiver and provide integrity.  
For authentication, you either need a large set of pre-generated keys that are mapped to particular identities in a secure way (e.g., certificate signed by trusted certificate authority, as in PKI), or some other way to prove who generated each key pair.  This is the tremendous syncing effort you mention.  
The PKI method introduces many ways to authenticate as a user due to their many keys, so it actually reduces security by increasing the attack surface.  If you do things right, the bigger attack surface is balanced by the fact that an attack on an ephemeral key limits damage to a single message.  However, to enforce this limit, you have to have a secure, public place where a list of valid/used keys is maintained in real-time.  Otherwise the single-use keys could be re-used.
If you don't pre-generate keys, you need a long-term public/private key pair to establish ownership of the temporary pair through a method such as a signature.  You may reduce the risk of compromise to the long-term key pair by using it just for signing ephemeral key pairs.  However, this just reduces one type of risk associated with the long-term key pair.  You still have risks associated with generation, distribution, storage, and binding the long-term key pair to a particular user, and the ephemeral key pairs are dependent on the long-term key pair for their security.
For integrity, you can use digital signatures.  Many digital signature methods are similar to authentication methods, where a private key operation is the key security operation.
Bottom line: you may be able to increase security by using ephemeral key pairs for each message, but performance will be impacted, you have to be careful about implementation, and the security benefits are minimal.

"54032122","How to do ""Client Authentification"" if I'm not able to provide private key","I want to set up my local server to communicate with my client. They build TLS connection using Openssl. I try to implement double side authentication, like server would verify client and client also needs to verify server.
When I use certificates generated by my self, everything works fine. The code is as following. It's C++ code in client. I set up client cert, private key and intermediate cert. In server side I saved a CA cert.
The relationship is: CA signs intermediate cert, intermediate cert signs client cert.
As we know, the reason that we need to provide client private key is the client will signature a ""challenge"" then send to server. Server could get client public key by certificate chain and use it to decode the encrypt ""challenge"" to see if they matched. You could see this link for detailed process:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake
However in my scenario, I have no permission to get the private key. I only have an API to call, which takes the digest or anything we want to encode as input and return a string encoded by client private key.
Therefore I'm not able to pass any ""ClientPrivateKeyFileTest"" to TLS.
I searched openssl source code but all handshakes were done in this function: SSL_do_handshake() and I'm not allowed to modify this function.
// load client-side cert and key
SSL_CTX_use_certificate_file(m_ctx, ClientCertificateFileTest, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);
SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file(m_ctx, ClientPrivateKeyFileTest, SSL_FILETYPE_PEM);

// load intermediate cert
X509* chaincert = X509_new();
BIO* bio_cert = BIO_new_file(SignerCertificateFileTest, ""rb"");
PEM_read_bio_X509(bio_cert, &chaincert, NULL, NULL);
SSL_CTX_add1_chain_cert(m_ctx, chaincert)

m_ssl = SSL_new(m_ctx);

// get_seocket is my own API
m_sock = get_socket();

SSL_set_fd(m_ssl, m_sock)

// doing handshake and build connection
auto r = SSL_connect(m_ssl);

I think all handshake processes would be done after I call SSL_connect(). So I wonder is there other way I can do to complete the client-authentication?
For example, I could skip adding private key step but set up a callback function somewhere which can handle all cases when SSL needs to use private key to calculate something.
PS: The API is a black box in the client machine.

One more thing, these days I found that openssl engine may help this problem. But does anybody know what kind of engine is useful for this problem? The EC sign, verification or others?
Final update: I implemented a OpenSSL engine to reload EC_KEY_METHOD so that I'm able to use my own sign function. 

Thanks a lot!

It works fine in regular command prompt! The only difference is me lacking the Git config commands (C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe config -f .gitmodules --get submodule.Plugins/ShooterBase.path, etc.), which I didn't even notice until I made this post -- but even then, I don't know if they're causing the problem or how to disable them even if they were what was causing the issue.
I'm honestly puzzled -- it feels like I'm in backwards-land. My only guess is that Jenkins somehow sets an environment variable when switching from the private to the public repo, and that's messing with something. I've tried setting the GIT_SSH Environment Variable to <PATH_TO_SSH_EXE> -i <PATH_TO_MY_PRIVATE_KEY>, but I'm not sure if I configured it right, as I get a message saying it can't find my private key (I've tried both Windows and Unix-style paths).
This is driving me nuts; I can easily fix it by just going into the command prompt, but it's a real pain having a build fail until I manually go in and fix it. I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any help?

The certificate gets exported and then imported. However, the imported private key cannot be reassigned to the original certificate. I'm getting either ""The provided key does not match the public key for this certificate"" or ""Only asymmetric keys that implement ICspAsymmetricAlgorithm are supported"". Is there anything I'm doing wrong?
","// Attempt #1

CspParameters parameters = new CspParameters();
parameters.KeyContainerName = importedKeyName;
var rsaKey = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(parameters);
certificate.PrivateKey = rsaKey; // public key doesn't match the private key

CAPI (the library behind CspParameters) can't understand keys in CNG at all on Windows 7 or 8.1; it (theoretically) has support for it on 10, but you definitely have to tell it that the key lives in CNG (CspParameters.ProviderName).
The code here made a new CAPI key in ""Microsoft RSA and AES Enhanced Cryptographic Service Provider"" with ProviderType 24 that just happened to have the same local key name as your CNG key.
You didn't specify the flag UseExistingOnly, and the key didn't exist, so it made a new one... and that's why the public key didn't match what's in the certificate.
// Attempt #2

var rsaCngKey = new RSACng(CngKey.Open(importedKeyName));
certificate.PrivateKey = rsaCngKey; // Only asymmetric keys that implement ICspAsymmetricAlgorithm are supported.

The PrivateKey property only supports CAPI, either in get or set.  The set is really dangerous to ever use, because it doesn't modify the cert object, it modifies the state of the cert in the Windows Certificate Store system... which means it also affects any other now or future objects operating on the same (Windows) cert.
// Attempt #3
certificate.PrivateKey = null;
X509Certificate2 certWithKey = certificate.CopyWithPrivateKey(rsaKey); // The provided key does not match the public key for this certificate.

This is the same new random key created from Attempt 1.

If you remove Attempt 1, then merge 2 and 3, you should end up with
var rsaCngKey = new RSACng(CngKey.Open(importedKeyName));
X509Certificate2 certWithKey = certificate.CopyWithPrivateKey(rsaCngKey);

And that should work.  (If you've already imported the cert into the cert store, you can just add certWithKey into the cert store, which will have the same ""everyone suddenly knows about this"" updating change as cert.set_PrivateKey, except it's way more obvious that you asked the cert store to take a change)

"52860252","Javascript Signing a message using an Eth address as public key","as far as I understood, on Ethereum every wallet has a private and a public key.
the public key is the address. What I want to achieve is to SIGN a ""string"" with a public address, so that only that address (with the private key) can ""read"" the message.
I'm struggling in finding the best library to do this: i've seen openpgp and JEncrypt but both requires to have ""public / private"" keys specified in some particular format.
Is there any sdk that can help? With web3 is possible only to sign with private key..
","The term ""sign"" in public-key cryptography has a very specific meaning: it generally means the generation of a digital signature to verify the content and sender of a given message.
It sounds like what you're describing when you say ""SIGN"" is that you want to encrypt a message with the ETH address / public key, and decrypt the message with the wallet private key.
In public key cryptography, you encrypt with the public key and decrypt with the private key.

I'm struggling in finding the best library to do this: i've seen openpgp and JEncrypt but both requires to have ""public / private"" keys specified in some particular format.

Public and private keys will need to be in the proper format for any pgp implementation, and this is likely the problem with ETH addresses, because the ETH address is derived from the underlying key pair. This blog post contains a detailed explanation of the relationship between ETH addresses and key pairs.

","This topic is unrelated to Amazon EC2. It is purely a Linux configuration, the same as any Linux computer.
When you SSH to a Linux computer, you provide a private key. The server will look in the /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys file to find a matching public key. If the keys match, then the SSH session is permitted.
You can add add/remove keys in that file.
If you wish to be the only person who can SSH into the server, then:

Create a new keypair
Put the public half of the keypair in /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys
Remove any other keys from that file
Repeat for all users you have defined on the server

By default, EC2 creates the ec2-user, so if you haven't created any more users, you will only need to edit: /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys

","Setting up a rule in the security groups to restrict access to you instance is essential.
This way not the whole internet can try to access the instance.
But you are right. You can still login with the SSH-Private-Key and have full access.
To avoid this you can remove rights from the login user and transfer this rights to another user.
So you can login but you cannot do anything and need to change user first.
su privileged

The privileged user is secured by another password you need to know.
That way you should have pretty solid access control.
I hope that helps!

The issue I have is when I generate PrivateKey with given attestationChallenge and userAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds for data signing. Everything works as expected if I don't enroll new fingerprints however after enrollment of a new fingerprint I expect for that key to be permanently invalidated but this is not the case. Have you experienced the similar?

keyStore.load(null)
val keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(algorithm, ""AndroidKeyStore"")
val builder = KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(""alias"", KeyProperties.PURPOSE_SIGN)

","To answer my own question. PrivateKey will not be invalidated by OS if userAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds is set to a positive value. The key will only be invalidated on the enrolment of new fingerprint if its purpose is to be used only when authenticated with fingerprint.

The client is using private keys in default location (~/.ssh/id_{rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519}).

Can we arrange pass wordless authentication like ssh -i id_rsa ec2-user@52.48.32.12

Yes, the filename does not matter. But of course it has to be a valid private key.

Can we use two public keys and two private keys to authenticate to the same server from same client.

Yes. But servers are usually fine with accepting single key, so there is no need to do that.

The Problem
I want to encrypt some files in my server, after asking other people, i realized that the most recommended method is encrypt those files (larges) using a private key.
Now, i was looking for the docs and saw these methods

crypto.publicEncrypt(pubKey, buffer)
crypto.publicDecrypt(pubKey, buffer)
crypto.privateEncrypt(privKey, buffer)
crypo.privateDecrypt(privKey, buffer)

this is very confusing because i don't know what of them i must to use now, ahm... i don't know what is the most appropriate way to do this securely.
","tl;dr encrypt with the public key. Keep your private key safe.
Unfortunately, these methods are poorly named. privateEncrypt should be called something like sign and publicDecrypt should be called something like verify.
When using public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric encryption), one key can be used to write a cipher and the other key can undo that operation. Your public key is potentially known to everyone, and your private key is secret.
If you want to keep something secret, except from the owner of a certain key, you want to encrypt a message with their public key. So if Alice wants to receive encrypted messages, she'll share her public key A_pub and her secret key A_priv, she'll keep to herself.. You'll encrypt your message crypto.publicEncrypt(A_pub, buffer). She'll then decrypt that message with crypto.privateDecrypt(A_priv, buffer).
Doing it the other way is known as a digitial signature.

I was sent these directions:

Hmm, let's see.

Export the Public Key (.p7b or .cer) and the Private Key (.pfx) from the certificate.

Impossible. The private key isn't in the certificate. And there is no reason to export the public key. It's of no use without the certificate.

Set a password for your Private Key (.pfx).

Good.

Use your private key as your signing certificate.

This is completed and utter nonsense. A private key cannot be used as a certificate. It isn't a certificate. [It can however be used to sign things: if that's what they're talking about they should have said so, clearly.]

When you send a submission you will be prompted to enter in your signing certificate password, this will be the password you set for your Private Key (.pfx).

More nonsense, see above.

After you have exported both files successfully, send us a copy of your new Public Key (.p7b or .cer) to: [] 

Yet more nonsense. Sending the public key accomplishes nothing, and a .cer file isn't a key file, it's a certificate file.

I understand that .p7b or .cer  and .pfx would have the certificate included. So -- are they calling the public key plus the certificate, and the private key plus certificate, ""public key"" and ""private key""? 

They are talking rank nonsense. If those are really the directions you were sent, tell them so, send them back, get your money back, and start all over again with somebody that actually knows what they're talking about. These instructions cannot possibly have been even tested.

Is this the usual way this is done?

Of course it's easy to implement one card so the cloud knows which public keys it should use for the various encryption schemes.

could clarify this.

","Broadly:
For Asymmetric encryption you must first generate your private key and extract the public key.
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 8912
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key

To encrypt:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public.key -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.txt

To decrypt:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.key -in encrypted.txt -out plaintext.txt

Setup:
I have 3 machines: A, B, C. A and C don't have public IPs, B has a public IP. I want to access machine A from machine C: A <-- B <-- C.
I have a reverse tunnel connecting A <== B, which is done by running on machine A:
ssh [options] -R PORT_B:localhost:PORT_A USER_B@B_PUBLIC_IP -i user_B_private_key.pem

So, with this tunnel I can ssh from machine B into machine A using:
ssh -p PORT_B USER_A@localhost -i user_A_private_key

(Note: I don't use this and I don't have user_A_private_key on machine B)
And with this tunnel I can ssh from machine C into machine A using:
ssh -p PORT_B USER_A@localhost -i user_A_private_key

Question:
I want to know what happens to user_A_private_key on the last case (ssh to A from C using the tunnel A <== B, i.e., ssh on machine C to access machine A through machine B). Machine C is a server and it is safe. Machine B is a sort of Jump Box; it is safe, but I don't want it to know any private keys for security reasons.
Does the key in clear text ever leave machine C? Is user_A_private_key safe in this approach? Is this approach safe and/or recommended?

Note: on the SSH Server on machine B I am allowing TCP Forwarding and using GatewayPorts (clientspecified)
","In SSH, the private key never leaves the client machine. The servers are getting only the signatures and public key, which proves the possession of the private key.

The problem is, if an application gets compromised, keys would also become compromised. If I could somehow let an app sign something, but don't let it touch actual keys, that wouldn't completely solve my problem (as an attacker would still be able to sign anything for some time), but reduce the impact (like, we won't have to revoke the keys).
For example, in case of SSL servers there's no such problem because usually there's no practical need for an application to access the keys. Hence, they can be semi-securely stored in a separate location. E.g. a webserver (like nginx) would be able to read the keys, but not the application.
Am I overthinking it? Is it even worthy thinking of?
","If you have very high security needs you could consider moving the keys to a completely independent server, or better yet a hardware security module (but those are expensive). Like you mention it can help prevent the loss of keys, but if the app is compromised the attacker could still sign whatever they wanted.
The main reason to go through the trouble then is auditing. That is if you have your signing server or device keep logs of everything it signs, then if only your app is compromised you will be better able to assess the extent of the damage (assuming you're signing server has not been compromised).
So yes there are benefits, but your first focus should be on securing your main application properly, because once that's compromised you're already having a very bad no good day, even if you have moved your keys to a sperate service.

","Create a separate, lightweight signing application that listens on an UNIX socket and runs as a separate user from the main app; when your app wants to sign something it throws the file and any additional info down that socket, and gets back the signed file.
If the application ever gets compromised the attacker will still be able to sign files as long as he is still on the server, but unless he uses a privilege escalation exploit to get root privileges and copy the signing app's key, he won't he able to steal the key and then sign at will without being connected to the server.
You can replace the UNIX socket with a standard TCP socket and put the signing app on a separate server for extra security; make sure to implement some basic access control on the signing app and of course use proper firewall rules to make sure the signing server is never exposed to the internet, or simplify things a bit by using a ""setuid"" binary for signing that gets invoked by your app, in that case the signing binary will run as a different user with additional privileges to access the keys, while the webapp itself doesn't have such privileges.
Basically you should implement a rudimentary software HSM.

I'm working on using DTLS.NET to do the handshake. One trick is that DTLS.NETseems to want a pem file instead of an X509 Certificate from the Windows Certificate Store. I believe I've figured out how to load the cert, except the private key. The private key is not exportable, and I don't believe I can change that.
public void LoadX509Certificate(X509Certificate2 certificate)
{
    if (certificate == null)

    {
        CertChain = new List<byte[]>() { certificate.RawData },
        CertificateType = TCertificateType.X509
    };
}

I believe I've figured out up to the certificate verify message and that's where it appears to need the private key. 
CertificateVerify certificateVerify = new CertificateVerify();
byte[] signatureHash = _HandshakeInfo.GetHash();
certificateVerify.SignatureHashAlgorithm = new SignatureHashAlgorithm() { Signature = TSignatureAlgorithm.ECDSA, Hash = THashAlgorithm.SHA256 };
certificateVerify.Signature = TLSUtils.Sign(_PrivateKey, true, _Version, _HandshakeInfo, certificateVerify.SignatureHashAlgorithm, signatureHash);
SendHandshakeMessage(certificateVerify, false);

I can't seem to find much information in the RFCs or elsewhere that describe exactly what needs to happen here. I do know that the server can handle RSA, DSS, or ECDSA, so I left it with ECDSA since that's what DTLS.NET is using.
Do I actually need the private key to create the CertificateVerify message?
Thanks in advance!
","The handshake may authenticate the client by it's certificate. 
Though the certificate on it's own is ""public"", everyone would be able to send it and the authentication could not be granted.
Therefore the client has to proof, that he has access to the private key as well. That's why the ""Certificate Verify"" message is used.
If you don't have access to the private key of your public key of your certificate, a client certificate handshake is not possible.
Maybe the keystore doesn't export that private key, but offer instead a ""signing"" function, where that privte key is applied.

What I am doing is using the ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P224(), rand.Reader) function that ecdsa provides and trying to store that key in the ledger with the PutState() function of shim. The type of variable that is in struct is ecdsa.PrivateKey but when I try that the chaincode seems to stop and get the following error:
Error: could not assemble transaction: ProposalResponsePayloads do not match - proposal response: version:1 response:
Of course this indicates that the chaincode is not installed in both Organization peers. But I have. Then I tried to convert the ecdsa.PrivateKey into bytes and then to string but nothing seems to work. I will attach the code bellow.
    type UserDetails struct {
ObjectType string          `json:""docType""`
FirstName  string          `json:""firstName""`
LastName   string          `json:""lastName""`
PublicKey  ecdsa.PublicKey `json:""publicKey""`
PrivateKey []byte          `json:""privateKey""`
    }

This above is my structure
    priv, err := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P224(), rand.Reader)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
}

enc_key := priv.D.Bytes()
fmt.Println(enc_key)

bytesPrivK := string(enc_key)



objectType := ""userDetails""
userDetailsReg := &UserDetails{objectType, firstName, lastName, *ecdsaPublicKey, enc_key}
userDetailsJSONasBytes, err := json.Marshal(userDetailsReg)
if err != nil {
    return shim.Error(err.Error())
}
fmt.Println(userDetailsReg)
// === Save userDetails to state ===
err = stub.PutState(lastName, userDetailsJSONasBytes)
if err != nil {
    return shim.Error(err.Error())
}

I also tried with the ecies package to generate an ecies private key then convert it to ecdsa and store it but still same error. I used ecies cause I need to encrypt message with the ecies encryption.
prv, err := ecies.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, ecies.DefaultCurve, nil)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err.Error())
}

eciesPrivatePem, err1 := ecies.MarshalPrivate(prv)
if err1 != nil {
    fmt.Println(err1)
}
encodedToStr := string(eciesPrivatePem)

ecdsaPrivate := prv.ExportECDSA()

Here I tried either to store in an ecies.PrivateKey type or in string or even ecdsa.PrivateKey but always getting the same error.
I am using the Hyperledger Fabric and CouchDB for this. Does anyone know why I cant store that even as a string? It seems really strange that even as a string a cant store it although the other 2 variables are strings and 1 ecdsa.PublicKey types. I cant find any other error in logs that indicates something more here. 
Any help or recommendation would be appreciated.
Thank you
","I found out that the problem was truly been generated from the peers. The endorsement policy error that I was getting has to do with the peers and I had difficult times to find the solution. 
So, the problem was that in my chaincode I was storing a key in the ledger that was generated through  a function that I had to pass as a parameter a random variable : rand io.Reader
That random variable was created each time in each peer differently so that was causing a conflict in the peers. 
To conclude, keep in mind that each time you are creating a chaincode and you run it, you install it in 2 or more peers and each peer runs the chaincode differently! Very important.

"56526038","Android: Decryption process is taking lot of time","When we create the set of keys with following code:
val generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(RSA)
generator.initialize(KEY_SIZE)
val keyPair = generator.genKeyPair()

Then when we call following:
val cipher = Cipher.getInstance(RSA_TRANSFORMATION)
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, privateKey)

The init method execution is done within 0-2 milliseconds.
But when we try to create the key with following as we need to store the private key in keystore :
val keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(""RSA"", ""AndroidKeyStore"")
        keyPairGenerator.initialize(keyGenParameterSpecBuilder.getProvider()

The same init method takes more than 35-40 milliseconds for execution. Also if we comment setEncryptionPaddings and setDigest the init method throws exception.
Expected Output: 
To be able to store the private key in KeyStore and execution of init method in 0-2 milliseconds as it does without provider generator.
","AndroidKeyStore is always going to be significantly slower than in-process key operations.
What happens when you do an in-process key generation is a JNI call to the BoringSSL crypto library.  No IPC calls, no context switches, etc.  BoringSSL will make some syscalls to the kernel to get random bits (from /dev/random) and there's a small chance that could trigger some calls into the hardware true random number generator, but not much.
What happens when you do a key generation in AndroidKeyStore is (roughly; everything below the hardware binder call is implementation-dependent so you'd have to talk to your device maker to learn the details):

Your process makes a binder call to the Keystore process, which may spin up a thread to process your request.
Keystore gets some random bits from /dev/random.
Keystore makes a hardware binder call to the Keymaster HAL service.
The service formats the key generation request into a message and writes it to a character device node, which invokes a kernel driver.
The kernel driver copies the request into a buffer along with some control data and invokes the SMC instruction.
The processor suspends Linux and jumps into the secure monitor handler, which checks a bunch of stuff, then switches the processor into secure mode.
The trusted OS kernel starts executing, reads the control data from the transfer buffer, identifies the trusted app which is supposed to receive it and calls it.
The trusted app parses the request message and generates your key, obtaining necessary random bits by reading from the hardware true random number generator and securely mixing that entropy with the bits provided by keystore (from /dev/random).
The trusted app then encrypts the key with a hardware-bound key and writes the result into a response buffer and returns control to the trusted OS.
The trusted OS writes some control data and invokes the SMC instruction.
The processor suspends the trusted OS and jumps into the secure monitor handler, which checks a bunch of stuff, then switches the processor out of secure mode.
The Linux kernel starts executing and the kernel driver returns data through the character device node.
The HAL service reads the data from the character device node.
The HAL service parses data the and returns it via hardware binder.
Keystore receives the encrypted key bundle and writes it into a file (associated with the alias you provided).
Keystore generates a self-signed certificate and writes it into another file.
Keystore returns the result status via binder.

I think the performance of AndroidKeyStore could be improved, but fundamentally it has to do a lot more than an in-process key generation does, and all of this IPC takes time.
What you get in exchange for the additional time is much greater security.  With in-process crypto, an attacker who compromises your app can get a copy of the private key and can then do anything they like with it.  With AndroidKeyStore, an attacker who compromises your app may be able to use the key the same way your app could, but they can't extract it from the device so they can't use it anywhere else.  Also, if you add some constraints on how it can be used (e.g. only when the user authenticates), then the attacker can't violate those constraints.
Those security guarantees hold even if the attacker compromises not just your app, but the keystore daemon, the HAL service, and even the Linux kernel itself.  To actually extract the key, the attacker has to compromise the trusted app or trusted OS.  That's not impossible (nothing is), but it's much, much harder.
For completeness, I should also mention KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.setIsStrongBoxBacked(true), available in API level 28.  On devices that support StrongBox (currently not many, but this will change) your key won't be generated in a trusted OS running in the secure mode of the main CPU, it will be generated in a purpose-built security processor -- an embedded Secure Element, or similar -- called a ""StrongBox"".  StrongBoxes must share no processor, RAM or other significant resources with the main CPU, and must be formally evaluated for security against direct penetration, side channels, glitching and more by an accredited testing laboratory.
StrongBox devices are typically much smaller, slower processors than mobile CPUs. Usually around two orders of magnitude slower in raw speed, though they partially offset that with dedicated crypto accelerator hardware.  This means that if you use KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.setIsStrongBoxBacked(true) you can expect not 40 ms, but 400 ms, or maybe 1000 ms.  On the other hand, extracting any secrets from StrongBox devices is extraordinarily difficult.  National intelligence agencies can probably do it, with effort, if they care enough.  Anyone less capable than that is likely to have a very tough time indeed.
(As an aside:  If you want to improve performance, you should consider dumping old, slow RSA.  EC is much faster.  Unfortunately, if you need asymmetric encryption, AndroidKeyStore doesn't yet support encryption/decryption with EC, only signing/verification.  However, if you can get by with symmetric crypto, AES and HMAC are much faster than both EC and RSA.)
(Aside:  I'm the Google engineer who has been responsible for AndroidKeyStore since API level 23.)

You run ssh-add

At this point you can connect to A. Big woop, so what ? Well, if from A you connect to B, it will just work. This is very secure and there is a single key you have to worry about: your own.

","If you are importing a PFX to add it to a persisted store you want to specify the X509KeyStorageFlags.PersistKeySet flag.  If you don't, at some undetermined point later the garbage collector notices no one cares about the key and then asks Windows to delete it... and then the version added to the X509Store can no longer find its key.

"53229641","How can I tell if given data is encrypted with a public key","I'm going to re-phrase my question completely so it makes more general sense (and correct my blunder with AES/RSA).
Alice has a large block of data to send to Bob via a local mailbox that isn't secure.  To keep her data from prying eyes, she does this:

She generates a random 256-bit key
She uses AES-256 encryption to encrypt the data using the key
She uses Bob's public key to encrypt the key she's used
She puts the encrypted data and the encrypted key in the mailbox addressed to Bob

Mike the mailman picks up the mail from the mailbox.  However, he doesn't want to lug the data all the way across the internet to Bob's place if bob isn't going to be able to decrypt it.
The question is, how can Mike ascertain whether the key has actually been encrypted using Bob's public key?
In my application I need to transport sensitive data to a data centre.  To achieve this, I have an upload process that accepts files (that have already been AES-encrypted with a key, then the key is encrypted with the recipient's public key) and sends them to the data centre.  The corresponding private key is held at the data centre and used to decrypt the files on receipt.  This is currently in the design stage so there is some flexibility on the public/private key technology to be used but it's likely to be a C# application that's doing the work.
I would like to protect against uploading files that have NOT been encrypted using the public key (because I may waste significant bandwidth and the receiving application at the datacentre will fail to decrypt them).
So, what I want to know is how can I tell at the sending end whether a file has been encrypted using a given public key?
In a nutshell, I have an encrypted file and a public key.  Has the file been encrypted with that key?
Thanks in advance etc.!

That is, prevent uses 'playing the system' and developing their own scripts/apps to use the API (and hence potentially misuse the service).

","You can make it harder to ""play the system"", but you cannot hide any secrets on your client's computer.

3.do not use any way that needs to store some data on the key receiver.
the only way that i can see is sending a random message that encrypted by the public key and ask from the key owner the decrypted message to compare them and ensure the public key sender have its private key too; but this way needs a promise like and two steps to verifying and storing some data:

receive a public key and send the encrypted random string and wait
receive the decrypted data and compare them with original string

now do you know any way to do this verifying without need to storing any data

","Using S/MIME as an example, one pre-requisite of encrypting a message to the recipient is to have their Public Certificate. 
Now, of course, the recipient can first send you their certificate as an attachment, however, it is more common for the recipient to first send you a signed email. 
This signed email would prove that the recipient has access to their private key as they would hash the contents of the email and then sign the hash with their private key.

At this point ...

... the process reads a file which contains the private key.
So whatever user the process is running as needs read permission on the private key.
What is the best way to do this from a security point of view ?
Would it be considered bad practice to run the process as 'foo' and give foo read permissions to the PK ? That doesn't sound ideal to me but I just can't see how the type of code in the example can run otherwise ?
I know Apache, for instance, starts as root and then spawns a process under a user with lesser rights. Is that the type of thing that might be done in this circumstance ? Is there a good example of doing that pythonically ?

EDIT: OK well it seems as if this https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/os.html#os.setuid would allow the process to start as root and then run under a different owner (if that was considered necessary where access to PK is needed like here). Would be interested in any examples of it being done in Python ... as well as any other approaches which might be valid.

EDIT: Just to add to the comment about the use of os.setuid having read this https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/166817/using-the-setuid-bit-properly there do seem to be a number of risks which are difficult to mitigate in my case . I would be interested in any suggestions in how others have managed to write Python scripts which access Private Keys without running as root.

If the certificate is in a user store, you must impersonate that user and access its personal store. In this case, you can export the key if the key is marked as exportable.
If the key is generated by a PKI, there is also the possibility that the key is available at the PKI but this depends strong on the configuration of the PKI

-srcalias [ALIAS_SRC] -destkeystore [MY_KEYSTORE.jks]
-deststoretype jks -deststorepass [PASSWORD_JKS] -destalias [ALIAS_DEST]

Does anyone know a way to do it?
","You didn't show the openssl command you used, but it's probably wrong, since the error you quote comes from openssl and not keytool, and as a result your keytool command couldn't possibly work.
However, your goal is unwise. The Java KeyStore API is designed to store a privatekey with a certificate (or chain) for it, and both keytool and most other programs won't work right or at all for a privatekey with no certificate. The usual practice in Java -- and mostly in OpenSSL as well -- when you have no real certificate(s) for a privatekey is to create a 'dummy' self-signed certificate; this does not extend trust as a real certificate does, but it fills the certificate-shaped hole(s) and allows programs to work at least up to the point they need valid trust.
There are two ways to do this. OpenSSL is easier, but not programming and hence not really ontopic:
openssl req -new -x509 -inkey privkey.pem [-days N] [-subj name] -out dummy.pem
# -subj name has the form /attr=value/attr=value/...
# where commonly used attrs are C (Country), ST (State/Province), 
# L (Locality), O (Organization), OU (Org Unit), CN (CommonName).
# if you omit -subj name you will be prompted for these (assuming normal config)
# -days defaults to 30
# if you modify the default config file or create and specify your own 
# you can configure a variety of X.509 extensions, but for a dummy cert 
# this is only rarely helpful, depending how you (will) use it

openssl pkcs12 -export -in dummy.pem -inkey privkey.pem -out keystore.p12 [-name alias]

# Java can use the PKCS12, but if you really want JKS for some reason
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -deststoretype JKS \
  [-srcstorepass p] [-deststorepass p] [-srcalias x [-destalias y]]
# most j8 can read PKCS12 without specifying it (due to a compatibility setting) 
# and all j9 up autodetect the source type;
# j8 defaults dest type to JKS but j9 up do not

Alternatively you can program this in Java. OOTB Java doesn't directly handle PEM format for keys, and more importantly handles only one of the eight formats used by OpenSSL -- and you carefully avoided telling us which you have. Also OOTB Java has no documented way to create a certificate; there are internal classes used by keytool, but after j8 it is increasingly difficult to use internal classes. Both of these are solved by BouncyCastle (bcpkix+bcprov) which supports OpenSSL PEM keys and generating X.509 certificates among other things.

I have a nodejs project that uses the Google Vision API/SDK and that sample project uses the google-cloud module and then uses this kind of structure to get the key file (reference here
  var gcloud = require('google-cloud');

  var datastore = gcloud.datastore({
    projectId: config.projectId,
    keyFilename: config.keyFilename
  });

However, when using the @google-cloud/vision module directly, you can also use the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable pointing to a file containing the key file and it ""just works"" as long as you export the environment variable or set the variable and initiate the command like so:
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/jomama/somefolder/keyfile.json node

So, considering the project will be tracked with git, my questions are:

What is the code level advantage of using either approach in the above?
What security issues need to be addressed in either approach?
Any other considerations I'm missing?

This means that if person A stores data encrypted with his private key, person B (if authorized) can also read this data with his private key.
The idea of ​​implementation:
For all authorized persons, a single symmetric key is generated on the server side. The key is used to encrypt and decrypt plain text data. Now, for each individual claimant, a key pair is generated (public and private). With the public key, the symmetric key is encrypted and stored for the user and there are several of these asymmetrically encrypted symmetric keys on the server. The private key is given to the user (as a file download, HTTPS), which later can be used to decrypt the encrypted symmetric key. Therefore He can upload his private key before writing or reading encrypted data, in a web application (client side) and send it to the server. The Server uses the private Key to encrypt the content of the user and save it, or decrypt older content and send it in plain text to the user.
My problem now is that the weak point is the server, where the private key of the user must first be sent to encrypt and decrypt. There might be someone with access this private key secretly intercept and save.

Exactly What i need is, Need to use same private key in android and ios once encrypted the string in android means, with the help of private key need to decrypt in iOS it should be exact result. I tried so many ways its not working. 
Didn't get any crashes. But When using Android private key in iOS i'm getting following error.. "" unable to decrypt"".

"56339685","CRT file does not contain a privatekey","I am preparing for a demo of a suite of apps on a private lan (not connected to anything but the machines involved).   There is no DNS, so all URLs are based on IP address.
Because of the validations done on the ssl certs, the cert cannot be a self-signed cert.   I have therefore used the following commands with openssl (for windows) to create a CA, and derived crt.   I have successfully done this several years ago, and I think I ran into this issue before, but I cannot remember how I solved it.   Nor can I find another post that solve the issue or reminds me what the solution was.
I am using the following commands:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem
openssl genrsa -out derived.key 2048
openssl req -new -key derived.key -out derived.csr
openssl x509 -req -in derived.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial -out derived.crt -days 1825 -sha256 -extfile derived.ext


[derived.ext file contents]
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = %%DOMAIN%%

The CA cert (myCA.PEM file] installs fine into the trusted roots folder. The derived.crt installs fine into the personal store, and validates properly with the CA.  However, the derived.crt does not show a private key and cannot be used for SSL. Can anyone tell me what step I got wrong or am missing?
","I seem to have solved the issue finally.   Apparently a .crt file cannot contain a private key.   Using the following command, I merged the .crt and key into a .pfx file, which imported and now shows a private key:
openssl pkcs12 -export -in derived.crt -inkey derived.key -out derived.pfx

Someone (hacker/cracker) steal (somehow), from a entity (let´s say, Google) all the private keys that they have stored.

How the end users will notice that the entity that they are talking with is not a trusted entity anymore (or at least until they get back or regenerate their own private keys)?

Since the thief has all private keys, the end users will establish a new communication with the ""trusted"" entity, both of them they will need to confirm that they are the people that they say they are (using private key) and, unless some security mechanism avoid this (automatic or manual) we will not avoid fraud or tampered data, am I correct?

Or is the Agent-Agent communication more complex, so even whether someone steal thousands of private keys, will be useless to him/her, and will need more data/components to perform some man-in-the-middle or similar, in order to success?

I know that tokenD is depreciated but I've got no choice but to use this for the moment.
The code is working : in my application, when I use the private key, the system automatically display me a dialog where I enter the token's PIN. It works ! I can use the private key and sign my data.
My problem is this one :  if I enter a wrong PIN, the system remembers it , and (I think) tries to use this bad PIN every time I try to access the private key, which automatically result in failure every time, of course.
To have the chance to enter the token's PIN again, I need to manually unplug and plug again the physical token .This is a problem.
I think this is a macOS (tested on mojave and catalina) bug because in the Keychain Access application, I see the same problem : if I try to access the ""Access Control"" of a private key's information, the application ask me for the PIN one time only, then probably try to use it forever automatically whether it's the a good or bad PIN.
My question is : Is there a fix for this ? What could I do to force the OS to ask me for the password again when I fail to enter it correctly ?
Is this even known ? Couldn't find anything on the net.
