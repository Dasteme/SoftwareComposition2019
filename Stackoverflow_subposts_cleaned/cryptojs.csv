Does CryptoJS expect data, key and initialization vector in some different way? As far as i understand, the IV are the first 16 bytes in data.

// See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11889329/word-array-to-string
function hex2a(hex) {
    var str = '';
    for (var i = 0; i < hex.length; i += 2)
        str += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex.substr(i, 2), 16));
    return str;
}

console.log(hex2a(plaintextArray.toString()));

The important bits are to specify no salt in your input and pass the key as a WordArray as jlvaquero says.  There are probably some efficiency improvements to be made, e.g. I'm guessing there's an easier way to convert a string to a WordArray than going to base64 and back, but at least it successfully decodes.  I lifted the hex2a function from StackOverflow question Word Array to  String.
Edit: I figured out how to convert strings to WordArrays and vice-versa with CryptoJS so the   extra base64 encode/decode and hex-to-ASCII function are not needed.  Also it turns out the salt property need not be specified.  This is more compact and efficient:

","You are using two libraries that try to accommodate input that is - strictly speaking - not valid. Rijndael requires keys that 16, 24 or 32 bytes long random byte strings. You provide a 13 character string. Mcrypt, the PHP library, uses the string (presumable utf8 encoded) directly as binary input and zero pads it to the required 32 bytes for MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256. CryptoJS on the other hand decides that you have entered something like a passphrase and instead uses a key derivation function to generate a 32 byte key.
Furthermore the encryption algorithms used don't even match. Mcrypt uses a seldom implemented variant of the original Rijndael for the 256 bit version, while CryptoJS implements the widely known variant AES256 of the Rijndael proposal. The 128 bit version of both (MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 and AES128) are identical though.
The third problem you are about to face later is that Mcrypt also uses a crazy padding scheme for the data being encrypted. As Rijndael is a block cipher, it can only encrypt blocks of 16, 24 or 32 bytes (depending on the variant - AES always uses 16 byte blocks). As such data has to be padded. Mcrypt does this in a non-injective way by just appending zeros. If you are only encoding strings this will not be so much of a problem for you as utf8 encoded strings never contain zero bytes, so you can just strip them off (CryptoJS even supports that natively).
The easiest fix to all these problems is to avoid having to implement any cryptography yourself (it is strongly discouraged anyway without a wide knowledge of the subject). Can you instead transmit your sensitive information over https which will use TLS (formerly called SSL) to encrypt and authenticate the channel?

Security notice: The code on this answer is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext attacks. See this answer instead for secure encryption.

Here is a working example of encrypting your string with PHP and decrypting it with CryptoJS.
On the PHP side:
Use MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 (not 256) to pair with AES. The 128 here is the blocksize, not the keysize.
Send the IV, too. You need the IV to decrypt.
$text = ""this is the text here"";
$key = ""encryptionkey"";

// Note: MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 is compatible with AES (all key sizes)
$iv = random_bytes(16);

$ciphertext = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $text, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);

echo ""iv:"".base64_encode($iv).""\n"";
echo ""ciphertext:"".base64_encode($ciphertext).""\n"";

Here is sample output from a test run:
iv:BMcOODpuQurUYGICmOqqbQ==
ciphertext:ZJAab8YtkRq5TL7uyIR7frM2b3krftJzn1pTqRTAda4=


IMPORTANT: Because we are not authenticating our ciphertext, decryption becomes vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. See also: authenticated encryption in PHP.

On the CryptoJS side:
Your key is only 13 ASCII printable characters which is very weak. Mcrypt padded the key to a valid keysize using ZERO bytes.
Convert the key and IV to word arrays.
I did not have much luck decrypting with ciphertext as a word array, so I've left it in Base64 format.
CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"")

// Mcrypt pads a short key with zero bytes
key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('encryptionkey\u0000\u0000\u0000')

iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse('BMcOODpuQurUYGICmOqqbQ==')

// Keep the ciphertext in Base64 form
ciphertext = 'ZJAab8YtkRq5TL7uyIR7frM2b3krftJzn1pTqRTAda4='

/**

 * This example code doesn't demonstrate AUTHENTICATED ENCRYPTION

 */

// Mcrypt uses ZERO padding
plaintext = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext, key, { iv: iv, padding: CryptoJS.pad.ZeroPadding })

"16600509","AES Encrypt in CryptoJS and decrypt in Coldfusion","We've got a Silent Login service written in Coldfusion9 that accepts encrypted strings from external systems and then decrypts based on an agreed Algorithm/Encoding setup. This has worked without issue for years now from systems running ASP/JAVA/PHP, but we now have a client who has no choice but to use CryptoJS to perform the encryption and for the life of me I cannot work out why this won't decrypt in Coldfusion.
My knowledge of encryption isn't brilliant but the thing I am noticing is the CryptoJS encrypted ciphertext for the exact same string/key differs every time i perform the encryption whereas in Coldfusion/Java i can always expect the exact same encrypted string. I'm not sure if this is encoding related or not but i've never run into this issue accepting encrypted strings from any other system before, so I am hoping it's the way I am encrypting in CryptoJS that is incorrect.

","There seem to be two issues:

CryptoJS is not using your variable as the key. As @Miguel-F mentioned, when you pass in a string, ""it's treated as a passphrase and used to derive [the] actual key and IV"". Both are randomly generated, which is why your encrypted result keeps changing. But more importantly, this means that CryptoJS is using a completely different key than the one in your CF code and that is why decrypt() fails. (At least it is part of the reason ...)
The second problem is that in addition to the algorithm ""AES"", there are two other encryption settings which must match: mode and padding scheme. While CryptoJS and ColdFusion use the same defaults for padding scheme, the ""modes"" are different:

ColdFusion uses ""ECB"". ""AES"" is actually short for ""AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding""
CryptoJS uses ""CBC"", which requires an additional iv (initialization vector) value.


You need to ensure all three settings are the same on both sides. Try using CBC mode in CF, since it is more secure than ECB anyway. Note: It requires adding an IV value.
CF Code:
<!--- this is the base64 encrypted value from CryptoJS --->

Edit:
All that said, what do you mean by the client ""has no choice but to use CryptoJS to perform the encryption""? Why cannot they use server side encryption? I am not an encryption expert, but doing encryption in javascript, and exposing the key on the client, does not sound wildly secure to begin with ...

"25492179","Decode a Base64 String using CryptoJS","I am trying to create a simple webpage with the goal to send and encrypted message to the server (which will create a file with that content), then a link is created and the user who receive the link provided will be able to see the encrypted value (since it provides the name of the file and the key).
The message is encrypted using CryptoJS AES, and the result is Base64 encoded to be decoded after that, only the Base64 of the encrypted message and the encrypted message is sent to the server nothing else, and this is done using Javascript.
My question here is. I have a message, let say ""Hello World"" which I encode using Base64, and it gives me this :
1ffffffff5a8ae57

If I send this value to a variable, and then just use that variable, it show a result :
// Works !
var test = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""Hello World"");
alert(CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(test));

Which is normal. But If I try to write directly the text (or just do a toString(), it doesn't work... which is also normal because the 'test' variable isn't a simple String variable) :
// Doesn't work !
var test = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""Hello World"").toString();
alert(CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(test));

But I need to use a String since it is based on a PHP $_GET Value which is then decoded using Javascript again. So my question is, how can I do this in order to encode a String and then decoded the result as a String ?
This is my engine.js file :
// Encrypt the message using a generated key
function encrypt(message, key) {
    return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, key);
}

// Encode String to Base64
function encodeBase64(value) {
    return CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(value.toString());
}

// Decode String from Base64 Enconding
function decodeBase64(encodedValue) {
    return CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(encodedValue);
}

// Decrypt the message using the generated key
function decrypt(encrypted, key) {
    return CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}

// Generate the random key
function generateKey() {
    return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16).toString();
}

// Generate the random fileName
function generateFileName() {
    return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16).toString();
}

// Convert the text on the form with the encrypted version to be sent into the server
function SendMessage(message, FinalURL) {
    if ((message.value).trim()) {
        var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest;
        xmlhttp.open(""POST"", ""index.php"", true);
        xmlhttp.setRequestHeader(""Content-type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"");

        // Generate the Key and Encrypt the Message
        var key             = generateKey();
        var encryptedData   = encrypt(message.value, key);
        var fileName        = generateFileName();      

        xmlhttp.send(""fileName="" + fileName + ""&encryptedMsg="" + encodeBase64(encryptedData));

        var finalURL = document.URL + ""?MessageID="" + fileName + ""&Key="" + key;

        FinalURL.innerHTML = ""<p>Final URL: <a href="" + finalURL + "">"" + finalURL + ""</a></p>"";
    } else {
        alert(""There is no text to be encrypted !"");
    }
}

","I ran into a similar confusion, and for reference, here is the solution. 
To turn a text string (UTF-8 encoded) into a base-64 string, you need:
var textString = 'Hello world'; // Utf8-encoded string
var words = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(textString); // WordArray object
var base64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(words); // string: 'SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ='

To turn a base-64 encoded string back into text (UTF-8 encoded), it's:
var base64 = 'SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=';
var words = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64);
var textString = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(words); // 'Hello world'

Some explanation
As you can see from the examples given in the CryptoJS documentation, parse is meant to parse a string in the format that the encoder is expecting (into a WordArray), and stringify turns a WordArray into a string. 
From the documentation:
var words  = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse('SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==');
var base64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(words); // 'Hello, World!'

The WordArray is CryptoJS's format-independent representation of data. Formatters (like Base64 and Utf8) are interfaces between this WordArray format, and strings, which may contain data encoded in any format. So to change between formats, you need a formatter at either end, one parsing and one stringifying (i.e. encoding). In this case, you need to remember that when we write 'Hello World', that's text encoded in a particular format (I'm assuming UTF-8).

","That error message usually means the data wasn't decrypted correctly, and the resulting plaintext bytes don't form valid UTF-8 characters. 
A couple things to check: 

First, make sure you're using the same password for both encryption and decryption. You may want to keep a hash of the correct password so that you can verify if the user gave the correct password before you use it for decryption. 
Second, make sure that the value item[key] is a string before encrypting. CryptoJS can't encrypt JSON objects. You'll have to serialize it first.

Your Java code uses the 128-bit AES key while your JavaScript code uses the 256-bit AES key.
Your Java code uses the ""Abcdefghijklmnop"".getBytes() as the actual key value, while your JavaScript code uses the ""Abcdefghijklmnop"" as the passphrase from which the actual key is derived.
The default transformation for Java AES is AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding, while default transformation for CryptoJS is AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding.

One way to fix your example is to fix the JavaScript side:
// this is Base64 representation of the Java counterpart
// byte[] keyValue = new byte[] { 'A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g',
//                'h', 'i', 'j', 'k','l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p'};
// String keyForJS = new BASE64Encoder().encode(keyValue);
var base64Key = ""QWJjZGVmZ2hpamtsbW5vcA=="";
console.log( ""base64Key = "" + base64Key );

// this is the actual key as a sequence of bytes
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64Key);
console.log( ""key = "" + key );

// this is the plain text
var plaintText = ""Hello, World!"";
console.log( ""plaintText = "" + plaintText );

// this is Base64-encoded encrypted data
var encryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintText, key, {
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
});
console.log( ""encryptedData = "" + encryptedData );

// this is the decrypted data as a sequence of bytes
var decryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt( encryptedData, key, {
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
} );
console.log( ""decryptedData = "" + decryptedData );

// this is the decrypted data as a string
var decryptedText = decryptedData.toString( CryptoJS.enc.Utf8 );
console.log( ""decryptedText = "" + decryptedText );

","For Java and JavaScript to able to inter operate, it is essential that no defaults are used while creating Key or the Cipher. The iteration count, key length, padding, salt and IV should all be the same.

"29512858","CryptoJS and key/IV length","I have question about AES key and IV length.
First of all, if, for example, I'm using drugs OpenSSL extension and openssl_encrypt() method, I can clearly see that key for 256-bit AES should be 32 bytes, and IV throws warning if it's different than 16 bytes. I can understand that, and everything is fine.
However, in CryptoJS library the key and IV length is frustrating. This is some example:
var text = ""test"",
    key  = ""us5N0PxHAWuIgb0/Qc2sh5OdWBbXGady"",
    iv   = ""zAvR2NI87bBx746n"";

key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key);
iv  = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv);

crypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, key, { iv: iv });

where key is 32 bytes, IV is 16. CryptoJS requires to parse it, and after CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse() I get 48 and 24 bytes accordingly. I expect that those values will get truncated to required 256-bit AES length, and further expansion to n bytes will be irrelevant, and so resulting ciphertext will be the same.
But that's not actually happening. When I pass to CryptoJS.AES.encrypt() larger size key and even IV, it's producing different output. So my question is, why? What is the difference between CryptoJS  library and OpenSSL in this case?
","Looks like I've got it.
If you tend to pass custom key and IV in using CryptoJS, make sure that (assuming that CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse() gives HEX string, which is used in CryptoJS.AES.encrypt()).
Taking this example, with Base64 key and iv (length=22), which CryptoJS encrypts as AES-256:
var message = ""some_secret_message"";

var key = ""6Le0DgMTAAAAANokdEEial""; //length=22
var iv  = ""mHGFxENnZLbienLyANoi.e""; //length=22

key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key);
//key is now e8b7b40e031300000000da247441226a, length=32
iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv);
//iv is now 987185c4436764b6e27a72f2fffffffd, length=32

var cipherData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, key, { iv: iv });

var data = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherData, key, { iv: iv });
//data contains ""some_secret_message""

Length of the key is 32 bytes for AES-256. (16 bytes if you want to get AES-128. If more, CryptoJS will switch to higher key length). In other case on decrypt you will get an empty message. Example:
var message = ""some_secret_message"";

var key = ""6Le0DgMTAAAAANokdEEial1""; //length=23
var iv  = ""mHGFxENnZLbienLyANoi.e""; //length=22

key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key); // length = 17 bytes
//key is now e8b7b40e031300000000da247441226a5d, length=34 (hex encoded)
iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv); // length = 16 bytes
//iv is now 987185c4436764b6e27a72f2fffffffd, length=32 (hex encoded)

var cipherData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, key, { iv: iv });

var data = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherData, key, { iv: iv });
//data contains """" - an empty string

Also, from what I can see, only x % 8 == 0 bytes of such use case gives valid result.
Length of IV should be 22 bytes (when Base64 encoded), and while transforming with CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse() you will get 16 bytes (32 hex encoded), which is max for AES-256 block size. Everything more than that will get truncated.
var message = ""some_secret_message"";

var key = ""6Le0DgMTAAAAANokdEEial""; //length=22
var iv  = ""mHGFxENnZLbienLyANoi.e""; //length=22

key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key); // length=16 bytes
//key is now e8b7b40e031300000000da247441226a5d, length=32 (hex encoded)
iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv); // length=16 bytes
//iv is now 987185c4436764b6e27a72f2fffffffd, length=32 (hex encoded)

var cipherData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, key, { iv: iv });

var key = ""6Le0DgMTAAAAANokdEEial""; //length=22
var iv  = ""mHGFxENnZLbienLyANoi.e123""; //length=25

key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key); // length = 16 bytes
//key is now e8b7b40e031300000000da247441226a5d, length=32 (hex encoded)
iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv); // length = 18 bytes
//iv is now 987185c4436764b6e27a72f2fffffffded76, length=36 (hex encoded)

var data = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherData, key, { iv: iv }); //data contains ""some_secret_message"", so additional ""123"" in IV is irrelevant.

","Encryption is done with a key, which is a set of binary bits, not a password, which implies a human-readable string.
To go from a password to a key, one can use a Password Based Key Derivation Function, such as PBKDF2.  Crypto-JS already has a PBKDF2 function built-in, i.e.
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/pbkdf2.js""></script>
<script>
    var salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

    var key128Bits = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""Secret Passphrase"", salt, { keySize: 128/32 });
    var key256Bits = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""Secret Passphrase"", salt, { keySize: 256/32 });
    var key512Bits = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""Secret Passphrase"", salt, { keySize: 512/32 });

    var key512Bits1000Iterations = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""Secret Passphrase"", salt, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: 1000 });
</script>

In general, use as high an iteration count as you can get away with. 
Salt should be a random value, as in the example above; you'll need, of course, to store that value along with the iteration count in order to get the same key given the same passphrase.

var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
        encrypted,key,

            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
        }
    );
console.log('decrypted:'+decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

Let's notice that encrypted parameter is the results from the previous call to CryptoJS.AES.encrypt. It's an object.
The problem I have is when I try to decrypt directly the string:
// Decription. It fails with manual data
var manual_data = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('3f0e590d2617dc7007b89350bd590409');

            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
        }
    );
console.log('decrypted, by hand:'+decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

It returns an ""empty"" object (an empty string in the above example). It seems like there is some data that CryptoJS.AES.decrypt needs which is stored into the encrypted object of the first example but missing from the wordarray of the second example.
Does anybody knows why is this happening?
","I have been messing with this a while and I think I have found your problem. The main problem is this line encrypted.ciphertext.toString(). What you want is just encrypted.toString(). 
The toString function is defined for this object by CryptoJS and it returns the encrypted message that can be sent around safely. So if we change that we will have something like this:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
  message,
  key,
  {
    iv: iv,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  }
);
console.log('            encrypted: '+encrypted.toString());

This will output Pw5ZDSYX3HAHuJNQvVkECQ== instead of 3f0e590d2617dc7007b89350bd590409. The reason your second function is working is because it doesn't use encrypted.ciphertext.toString() it just uses the actual object so no changes on that one. For the last one we will have the change the wrong text you were using to the new text that is returned without the ciphertext part but we also have to remove the CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse. I don't really know what you were doing here but I can investigate if you meant something by that. 
var manual_data = 'Pw5ZDSYX3HAHuJNQvVkECQ==';
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
  manual_data,
  key,
  {
    iv: iv,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  }
);
console.log('   decrypted, by hand: '+decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

This should log the right stuff. 
I have even created a JSBin for this. It is my first time using JSBin so I hope I did it right.

","I have been very pleased with forge (node-forge). When working with crypto, sometimes simply better error messages make all the difference.
https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge
Not sure whether this goes against the ""just use native javascript"" condition, but it is available as a simple package, is well documented/easy to use, and throws helpful errors on failure.
Caveat: I could not get forge to work with Buffer objects, but had immediate success using forge's built-in base64/utf8 utilities and buffers.

","You're not doing the same thing on both sides.
IV
You did parse the IV in CryptoJS, but forgot to do it in PHP:
$iv_dec = pack('H*', ""101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f"");

To fix that your IV is wrong, you probably noticed that the first 16 bytes are gibberish. That happens when the IV is wrong. Note that CryptoJS uses CBC mode by default, so the IV has only influence on the first block during decryption. Remove this:
$ciphertext_dec = substr($ciphertext_dec, 16);

Padding
You probably noticed that most plaintexts don't come out right. They end with some strange repeated characters at the end. This is the PKCS#7 padding that is applied by default in CryptoJS. You have to remove the padding yourself in PHP. Good thing is that Maarten Bodewes has provided a proper copy paste solution for this here.
trim() might be appropriate for ZeroPadding, but not when a proper padding scheme like the one defined in PKCS#7 is used. You may remove the trim() call altogether, because it is not useful and may result in unexpected plaintext, becauses zero bytes and whitespace is trimmed from the beginning and end.

I use the same key and IV, what do I do wrong?
","Hello,
in order to achieve this it should be considered to use the key and iv with 32 hex digits each, i had to solve exactly this doing my stuff and here is the way it goes
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js"">
</script>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
//The key and iv should be 32 hex digits each, any hex digits you want, but it needs to be 32 on length each
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"");
var iv =  CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210"");
/*
if you wish to have a more friendly key, you can convert letters to Hex this way:
var a = ""D"";
var hex_D = a.charCodeAt(0).toString(16);
just to mention,
if it were to binary, it would be:
var binary_D = a.charCodeAt(0).toString(2);
*/

var secret = ""Hi, this will be seen uncrypted later on"";

//crypted
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(secret, key, {iv:iv});
//and the ciphertext put to base64
encrypted = encrypted.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);    
//Assuming you have control on the server side, and know the key and iv hexes(we do),
//the encrypted var is all you need to pass through ajax,
//Let's follow with welcomed pure JS style, to reinforce one and other concept if needed
var xh = new XMLHttpRequest();
xh.open(""POST"", ""decrypt_in_php.php"", true);
xh.setRequestHeader(""Content-type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"");
xh.send(""encrypted=""+encodeURIComponent(encrypted));
</script>

And now receiving and decrypting in PHP
<?php
//Here we have the key and iv which we know, because we have just chosen them on the JS,
//the pack acts just like the parse Hex from JS

$key = pack(""H*"", ""0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"");
$iv =  pack(""H*"", ""abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210"");

//Now we receive the encrypted from the post, we should decode it from base64,
$encrypted = base64_decode($_POST[""encrypted""]);
$shown = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $encrypted, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);

echo $shown;
//Although the decrypted is shown, there may be needed to trim and str_replace some \r \n \x06 \x05, if there is not a better ""trim"" way to do it though
?>

With this we will have back the ""Hi, this will be seen uncrypted later on""

","Here is a solution based on this comment, using openssl_decrypt from PHP.
The JavaScript part (development with NodeJS for browsers) — first, install CryptoJS with npm install crypto-js, then your JS code:
import aes from 'crypto-js/aes'
import encHex from 'crypto-js/enc-hex'
import padZeroPadding from 'crypto-js/pad-zeropadding'

// message to encrypt
let msg = ""Hello world"";

// the key and iv should be 32 hex digits each, any hex digits you want, but it needs to be 32 on length each
let key = encHex.parse(""0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"");
let iv =  encHex.parse(""abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210"");

// encrypt the message
let encrypted = aes.encrypt(msg, key, {iv:iv, padding:padZeroPadding}).toString();

// and finally, send this ""encrypted"" string to your server

On the PHP side, your code will look like that:
// we use the same key and IV
$key = hex2bin(""0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"");
$iv =  hex2bin(""abcdef9876543210abcdef9876543210"");

// we receive the encrypted string from the post
$encrypted = $_POST['decrypt'];
$decrypted = openssl_decrypt($encrypted, 'AES-128-CBC', $key, OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING, $iv);
// finally we trim to get our original string
$decrypted = trim($decrypted);

","You can't decrypt with a random initialisation vector  - you need to use the same IV the data was encrypted with. Also, IIRC, AES defaults to an 8 bit representation of the encrypted data which will need to be handled carefully in transfer over HTTP.

","The problem is that in the CryptoJS code a password is used to derive the key and the IV to be used for AES encryption, but mcrypt only uses the key to encrypt/decrypt. This information needs to be passed to php. Since you don't want to transmit the password, you have to derive the key and IV in the same way in php.
The following code derives the key and IV from a password and salt. It is modeled after the code in my answer here (for more information).
function evpKDF($password, $salt, $keySize = 8, $ivSize = 4, $iterations = 1, $hashAlgorithm = ""md5"") {
    $targetKeySize = $keySize + $ivSize;
    $derivedBytes = """";
    $numberOfDerivedWords = 0;
    $block = NULL;
    $hasher = hash_init($hashAlgorithm);
    while ($numberOfDerivedWords < $targetKeySize) {
        if ($block != NULL) {
            hash_update($hasher, $block);
        }
        hash_update($hasher, $password);
        hash_update($hasher, $salt);
        $block = hash_final($hasher, TRUE);
        $hasher = hash_init($hashAlgorithm);

        // Iterations
        for ($i = 1; $i < $iterations; $i++) {
            hash_update($hasher, $block);
            $block = hash_final($hasher, TRUE);
            $hasher = hash_init($hashAlgorithm);
        }

        $derivedBytes .= substr($block, 0, min(strlen($block), ($targetKeySize - $numberOfDerivedWords) * 4));

        $numberOfDerivedWords += strlen($block)/4;
    }

    return array(
        ""key"" => substr($derivedBytes, 0, $keySize * 4),
        ""iv""  => substr($derivedBytes, $keySize * 4, $ivSize * 4)
    );
}

The salt is generated during encryption in CryptoJS and needs to be sent to php with the ciphertext. Before invoking evpKDF the salt has to be converted to a binary string from hex.
$keyAndIV = evpKDF(""Secret Passphrase"", hex2bin($saltHex));
$decryptPassword = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, 
        $keyAndIV[""key""], 
        hex2bin($cipherTextHex), 
        MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, 
        $keyAndIV[""iv""]);


If only encryptedPassword.toString() was sent to the server, then it is necessary to split the salt and actual ciphertext before use. The format is a proprietary OpenSSL-compatible format with the first 8 bytes being ""Salted__"", the next 8 bytes being the random salt and the rest is the actual ciphertext. Everything together is Base64-encoded.
function decrypt($ciphertext, $password) {
    $ciphertext = base64_decode($ciphertext);
    if (substr($ciphertext, 0, 8) != ""Salted__"") {
        return false;
    }
    $salt = substr($ciphertext, 8, 8);
    $keyAndIV = evpKDF($password, $salt);
    $decryptPassword = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, 
            $keyAndIV[""key""], 
            substr($ciphertext, 16), 
            MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, 
            $keyAndIV[""iv""]);

    // unpad (PKCS#7)
    return substr($decryptPassword, 0, strlen($decryptPassword) - ord($decryptPassword[strlen($decryptPassword)-1]));
}

The same can be achieved with the OpenSSL extension instead of Mcrypt:
function decrypt($ciphertext, $password) {
    $ciphertext = base64_decode($ciphertext);
    if (substr($ciphertext, 0, 8) != ""Salted__"") {
        return false;
    }
    $salt = substr($ciphertext, 8, 8);
    $keyAndIV = evpKDF($password, $salt);
    $decryptPassword = openssl_decrypt(
            substr($ciphertext, 16), 
            ""aes-256-cbc"",
            $keyAndIV[""key""], 
            OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, // base64 was already decoded
            $keyAndIV[""iv""]);

"26482494","Include CryptoJS in AngularJS application - Can't find variable: CryptoJS","I want to use CryptoJS in my AngularJS application, but I get this error: Can't find variable: CryptoJS.
I included this in my index.html:
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/rc4.js""></script>

And tried to encrypt something:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.RC4Drop.encrypt(""Message"", ""Secret Passphrase"");

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
","Preface:
This one took me a bit to sort out. I'm using the SHA1 library, but the implementation should be the same. I'm also using bower to manage my dependencies, but that shouldn't change anything on your end.
Solution:
In it's simplest implementation, you want to include the Crypto dependency after all your NG dependencies are wired (this is typically at the end of your index.html). For me I include 
<script src=""https://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/sha1.js""></script> 

after my last NG dependency which is 
<script src=""bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js""></script>

Then I add all my angular scripts (controllers, services, etc).
If you're using Bower, you can install the crypto library via 
bower install https://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/sha1.js --save

from there you can call CryptoJS.SHA1('some string');
note that the value you pass in has to be a string
You can call CryptoJS.SHA1('some string').toString(); to get the hashed value.
Pro tip:
You can also create a factory that you can inject into all your controls to better manage your dependencies. In my case, I went from MD5 to SHA-1 in about 20min, and this saved a ton of time.
angular.module('someApp')
.factory('crypt', function () {
    return {
        hash: function (value) {
            var str = JSON.stringify(value);
            return CryptoJS.SHA1(str).toString();
        }
    };
});

For testing:
If you're using karma and jasmine to test your app, don't forget to include the path of the crypto library to your karma.conf file in the files section. Otherwise you'll get a persistent Can't find variable: CryptoJS error.

"44714599","Cipher a string using crypto-js with hex encoding to make it url friendly","I am using crypto-js by brix. I have this function below that handles the encryption of a plain text.
import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js'
import AES from 'crypto-js/aes'

const SECRET = 'I am batman'
const plainText = 'This is Sparta!'

export function enc(plainText){

    // is not working, it just returns an '' empty string
    // it's a string, I checked using typeof
    return AES.encrypt(plainText, SECRET).toString();
}

How do I make the enc(string) to return a Hex value which is url friendly?
","You would likely want to do:
export function dec(cipherText){
   var bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherText, SECRET);
   var hex = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
   var plain = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
   return [hex, plain];
}

This takes the encrypted base64 string and will return the decrypted plaintext and hexadecimal.
EDIT: In regards to your comment and edited question:
const SECRET = 'I am batman'

function enc(plainText){
    var b64 = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plainText, SECRET).toString();
    var e64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(b64);
    var eHex = e64.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
    return eHex;
}

function dec(cipherText){
   var reb64 = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(cipherText);
   var bytes = reb64.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
   var decrypt = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(bytes, SECRET);
   var plain = decrypt.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
   return plain;
}

The end result takes the base64 string, makes it hexadecimal and returns the decrypted string.

Here is a sample of the code that i do the encryption in Javascript:

Do you have any idea why it fails that bad? Is it a different algorithm or do I fail somewhere else? 
","You're not using the same key and IV in CryptoJS and Java. The key and IV in the CryptoJS are too short to be valid, because you're parsing a 16 character string as Hex which results in only 8 bytes, but AES supports only key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bit.
Use 
var key = crypto.CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('0123456789012345');
var ive  = crypto.CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('0123456789012345');


Other considerations:

Always use a random IV. Since it doesn't have to be secret, you can prepend it to the ciphertext or send it along in another way.
Authenticate the ciphertexts with HMAC or use and authenticated mode like GCM to prevent some attacks such as padding oracle attack.

","From the CryptoJS documentation:

For the key, when you pass a string, it's treated as a passphrase and used to derive an actual key and IV. Or you can pass a WordArray that represents the actual key. If you pass the actual key, you must also pass the actual IV.

So in your line
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key);

""oijhd981727783hy18274"" is treated as a passphrase to create a key and not as the actual key.
Passing an IV works like this:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f');
var iv  = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f');

","You need a PEM-encoded key as the xero module merely calls out to node's built-in crypto module to sign some data. Those types of keys start with

and end with

You can generate such a key using the openssl command-line utility:

openssl genrsa -out privateKey.pem 2048

Then read privateKey.pem in node like:
var fs = require('fs');
var privateKey = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/privateKey.pem');

","This part of your code is wrong:

//->---------------------------------------------------------------------^^^^^^^

The 128/32 value is erroneous. You need either 128, 192 or 256. Currently you have the equivalent of 4, which seems to result in no output at all from the PBKDF2 function.
Also, in Java you should use DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(), or similar, to convert hex into bytes. Currently you are just calling getBytes() which isn't right. 
Finally, you need to specify CBC mode and PKCS#5 padding in order to match your Javascript code. So change the line to:
Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");

Is there anything that I am doing wrong here or Is there anyother simple way to do these kind of encryption and decryption ?
","Your Java code is riddled with errors. Here are a few of them:

Your initial exception is caused because your ""Secret Passphrase"" string contains 17 bytes. You need to truncate this to 16 bytes (or pad it to match 24 or 32 bytes). You need to match the behaviour of the CryptoJS library.
You are trying to hex-decode data that appears to be base64 encoded. Try using DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(hex);.
You are creating a secret key with the algorithm ""AES/CTR/NoPadding"". This in invalid, just use ""AES"".
You must pass an IV/nonce value into  your decryption:
cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, new IvParameterSpec(...));

The value you use will depend upon what CryptoJS is doing. Perhaps it uses all zeroes? Perhaps it generates a random one and you need to store it with the ciphertext?

This should be enough to get you started.

I need to know the different steps performed by CryptoJS while AES encrypting a message
","I'm looking at the documentation here:

key size: ""If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key.""
padding: Pkcs7 (the default) 
mode: CBC (the default) 
iv: generated and stored in the cipher text object: use with ""encrypted.iv""

Stuff for generating the key:

salt: generated and stored in the cipher text object: use with ""encrypted.salt"" (although it doesn't really say that, so I'm guessing here)
pbe algorithm: Unclear. It's not documented.
iteration count: I can't find this documented anywhere. The examples in the code seem to use 1000.

You can set the parameters by hand, which is maybe safer than relying on the defaults, e.g. some pseudo-code based on the examples in the documentation:
var salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128);
var key256Bits10000Iterations = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""Secret Passphrase"", salt, { keySize: 256/32, iterations: 10000 }); //I don't know this is dividing by 32
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", key, { mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7, iv:iv });

You will probably have to experiment. I'd take it one step at a time. Get the password-based keys to match by fiddling those parameters, then get the ciphertext to match, then figure out decryption. Avoid the urge to simplify things like skipping the IV or using ECB.

","CryptoJS uses the non-standardized OpenSSL KDF for key derivation (EvpKDF) with MD5 as the hashing algorithm and 1 iteration. The IV is also derived from the password which means that only the actual ciphertext, the password and the salt are needed to decrypt this on Java side.
In other words, PBKDF2 is not used for key derivation in password mode of CryptoJS. By default AES-256 is used in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding (which is the same as PKCS7 padding). Keep in mind that you might need the JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. See also Why there are limitations on using encryption with keys beyond certain length?
The following code recreates the KDF in Java (keySize and ivSize are 8 respectively 4 for AES-256 and come from ).

"27220297","What are the AES parameters used and steps performed internally by crypto-js while encrypting a message with a password?","Background: 
The application that I am working on is supposed to work offline. I should encrypt some text data using a password as a key at the java server side. The encrypted data is passed to the HTML5 page and at the client side using crypto-js library the server encrypted data should be decrypted. 
My issue:
In order to encrypt my message in such a way that the client can decrypt it with crypt-js (using a user entered password), I need to know the exact steps that  crypto-js expects while encrypting a message.
What I need to know:
I have the following encryption code which does the encryption of a message at the client side using crypto-js.
var message = ""my message text"";
var password = ""user password"";
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt( message ,password );
console.log(encrypted.toString());

I need to know the AES parameters used by CryptoJS while encrypting a message(Not sure what they are, but it sounds like: key size (256), padding (pkcs5), mode (CBC), PBE algorithm (PBKDF2), salt (random), iteration count (100))  . It would be a great help if some one could confirm it...I been trying to solve this mystery for the last few days?.
I need to know the different steps performed by CryptoJS while AES encrypting a message
","Following @Artjom B's great answer both on this question and here for python users, I am joining the full java code that helped me decrypt a string that was encrypted this way

    // Here I used the Android implementation (other Java implementations might exist)

    // prefix (first 8 bytes) is not actually useful for decryption, but you should probably check that it is equal to the string ""Salted__""
    byte[] prefix = new byte[8];
    System.arraycopy(cipherText, 0, prefix, 0, 8);
    // Check here that prefix is equal to ""Salted__""
    // Extract salt (next 8 bytes)
    byte[] salt = new byte[8];
    System.arraycopy(cipherText, 8, salt, 0, 8);
    // Extract the actual cipher text (the rest of the bytes)

","I've done some tests and apparently this reset function ( in crypto-js ) messes up. I'm not sure what it does and I don't have enough patience to look for an issue. :) However, here's the working solution:
function SHA256Encrypt(password, salt, iteration) {
    var saltedpassword = salt + password;
    for(var i = 0; i < iteration-1; i++) {
        alert(""saltedpassword = "" + saltedpassword);

    }
    saltedpassword = CryptoJS.SHA256( saltedpassword );
    return saltedpassword.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
}

which makes both codes even more similar, which is good.

","Use PKDF2 instead!
Why are you not using the built-in PBKDF2 from node-crypto:
var hashedpw = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, iterations, keysize);

and crypto-js:
var hashedpw = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(
    password, 
    salt, 
    { keySize: keysize/32, iterations: iterations }
);

Not only is it more secure than what you're trying to do by being much more expensive to compute than repeated hashing, it's also a lot easier to implement.

Can anybody give clear, simple instructions on how to use the CryptoJS library with Angular 2 and TypeScript.
I've installed CryptoJS using npm install crypto-js.
I've tried the recommended typings install crypto.js --ambient --save but this simply gives a warning about --ambient being deprecated and to use --global instead.
I've used --global instead but that then gives an error saying no typings were available!
Any advice to someone new to WebPack, NodeJS AND TypeScript would be appreciated. I have the CryptoJS library installed under node_modules folder but any ""sensible"" attempts to ""import"" CryptoJS fail with ""Module not found"".

","Here is the simplest step-by-step install and using example (working in nativescript/typescript/angular project):
npm install crypto-js

then:
npm install --save @types/crypto-js

Import in some component:
import * as crypto from ""crypto-js"";

And use it:
crypto.DES.decrypt(""Your secret"", ""YOUR_CRYPTO_KEY"");

The encrypted object usually stringifies into an OpenSSL format which might also contain the salt. If you're only interested in the actual ciphertext, then you need to stringify the ciphertext property.
Note that toString() takes an optional encoding function. Use the one that you need.

I was searching for a long time for a solution...will really love some help, thanks:)
","CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(..) creates WordArray object.
From your code : 
var salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);    

This means salt and iv is an object not a string.
You are able to log salt and iv as encoded because console.log calls  toString internally from salt and iv which encodes the WordArray 
All you need to do is encode these explicitly:
checkLogin(encrypted, randkey, salt.toString(), iv.toString());

Note: The error you've got is related with the JQuery; while building url parameters JQuery reads all objects, sub-objects, arrays and functions etc... , When you send WordArray as an object jQuery tries to call it's functions to fetch return value into the url parameter. 
In your case it is calling the concat function with an undefined parameters, which leads to the error you get. You can simply reproduce this error by calling $.param(salt) (or for iv).

"20053819","Google Spreadsheet: Encrypt cell content with Google Apps Script","I have a Google Spreadsheet and would like to encrypt the content of a few cells (I do not care which encryption method is being used as long as there is an equivalent decryption method for iOS).
Unfortunately there are no built-in encryption functions in Google Apps Script.
For this reason I would like to use a open source Javascript library like Crypto-JS and sjcl.
How can I use one of these libraries with Google Apps Script? 
In the Google Apps Script documentation, I have not found any clue on how to use external JavaScript libraries with my Google Apps Script.
","Well I'll say this, because this is the method that I used with Date JS. You can do the following:

Download the source .js file(s).
Open the .js file(s) in a text editor
Copy/paste all code into a new Script Project

here you can ""recreate"" the original .js files (copy/paste source individually) with the same names

Include the project key of that Script Project as a library of the project in which you want to use those functions.

Even if the projects are open-source you will want to make sure you comply with the licenses of those projects if you are going to use them.
This is basically a small ""hack"" around not being able to upload .js files into GAS Projects. Assuming that the JS is standard, this method will work with Google's system.

The other option is to simple find a light-weight one- or two-function crypto package, or a single crypto algorithm like AES-128 (taht you are given permission to use, of course). It really depends on how much encryption you want, if you need to reverse the cipher text to get the plain values, etc.
If this is a for some kind of password system, I would recommend using a simple hash. For example:
function stringHash (someString) {
    var hash = 0;
    if (this.length == 0) return hash;
    for (i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
        char = this.charCodeAt(i);
        hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char;
        hash = hash & hash;
    }
    return Math.abs(hash); // Personally I don't like negative values, so I abs'd it

in which you would ask for a user's password, and if the password hash matched the hash stored in the spreadsheet or wherever, then you would validate. You can use this to simulate logging into a UiApp GUI, for example: store usernames/password hashes in a database and validate a user before loading the ""real"" app.

However, as Serge mentioned, Spreadsheets will contain revision history of the original value before it was hashed, as well as the value after it was hashed. If you want to avoid this, use ScriptDB.

PS - in addition to this work-around, I'll say that it's not currently possible to ""import"" a non-GAS code library into your Script Project, unless you manually copy the source file-by-file into your Script Project. There may be a feature request on the Issue Tracker already, if not you can create one and I'll star it.

EDIT: As per request, I've included an open source AES encryption ""package"" (contains base64 as well, which is nice) in the answer, to act as a reference for others who want to encrypt in GAS. Make sure you follow the author's request, which is to retain his original copyright and link back to the source.
Other than the AES I linked and the simple hash (equivalent to Java's String.hashCode()), whose resource can be found here, there is Crypto-JS as you mentioned in your question and, if you took the time to fully copy/paste all the code (assuming that agrees with the terms of the license - I haven't read it), you could use that by the steps I described in the top half of my answer.
MD5 in Javascript is also an algorithm that you could use. If you use the code in md5.js which is located at the top of the page, you'll have what you need. Again, make sure you're following licensing rules if you use it.
Personally I would probably just use the hash and the base-64 patterns, as most of what you would use this encryption for is probably not incredibly important. AES might take a bit longer to compute - you can probably benchmark it yourself to see if it will cause major problems with triggers running for an extended period of time, but I doubt it would be a problem anyway.
Note: base-64 is 2-way, so is AES. MD5 is a type of hash, and the simple hash function I provided is also (of course) a hash. Hash functions are one-way. So if you need two-way functionality (encrypt/decrypt), then use base-64 or AES. Base-64 is essentially the kid version of AES. And the simple hash function is the kid version of MD5. Keep this in mind :)
Edit again: I'm not familiar with iOS development or its internals, but it seems to me that iOS can at least do some cryptographic operations. You may want to read more into those methods though, because I'm not really sure how you're putting GAS and iOS together; I can't give you any more help in that area unfortunately.

It's needed to access the API of a website. The website shows an example script in JavaScript using the CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify() method to encrypt the hash.
The result with this method is

I need to create the encoded string in C++. I've also already tried 4 different base64encode implementations (OpenSSL and custom codes), but also there I get the above result and the API always answers my string is not correctly encoded. 
So where is the difference, and does somebody know a C++ implementation for CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify()? 
","Let's call

Both conversions are correct, but depend on what you actually want.
For example the following two equations hold
toBase64FromBytes(toBytesFromUtf8(a)) == c
toBase64FromBytes(toBytesFromHex(a)) == b

It's a bad idea to trust some kind of online calculator, because they usually don't disclose how they encode stuff, so you will get arbitrary results. If you program it yourself, you get the expected results if you follow the documentation.
I suspect you got a by printing a hash or encryption result to the console like this:
console.log(result.toString()); // a

Most result objects in CryptoJS are WordArray types. When you call the toString() function on such an object, you get a Hex-encoded string of that binary object.
If you print result.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64) then you get the Base64-encoded string of the binary result.
If you take a and directly encode it to Base64, then it is probably assumed that a is already a string (e.g. UTF-8 encoded). An online calculator doesn't know that it is Hex-encoded.

","MD5 produces output of 128 bit, but a Triple DES key should be 192 bit long. That is why your PHP code copies the first 64 bits of the produced hash to the back. PHP and CryptoJS both use the EDE and this key copy leads to the key layout of K1 || K2 || K1.
You can do the same thing in CryptoJS. Since CryptoJS uses a WordArray to manage binary data internally as words of 32 bit, you can directly copy the first two words to the back of the internal array.


var pt = ""admin"";
document.querySelector(""#pt"").innerHTML = pt;

This code is not very secure for those reasons:

It uses Triple DES which only provides 112 bit of security, at best. You should use AES.
It uses a static IV. This is not semantically secure, because an attacker might see whether you sent the same message only by observing the ciphertexts. You need to use a random IV for each encryption and send it along with the ciphertext.
It doesn't use authentication. This system might be vulnerable to the padding oracle attack. It is an online attack which enables the attacker to decrypt any ciphertext with multiple tries. You either need to use an authenticated mode like GCM/EAX (not advisable for Triple DES) or run an HMAC-SHA256 over the ciphertext to produce the authentication tag and send it along with the ciphertext to verify it on the receiving end.

"21291279","How to convert to string and back again with CryptoJs","var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(jsonStr, 'youngunicornsrunfree', { format: JsonFormatter });

//convert encrypted to a string for transfer
//convert string back to Crypto object so it can be decrypted.

var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, ""youngunicornsrunfree"", { format: JsonFormatter });

The above two steps, work fine. But in between I need to convert encrypted to a string for transmitting over a network and then convert it back. How can I do this?
","Let's simplify this to be able to get to the problem. Firs we start with something like this:
jsonStr = '{""something"":""else""}';
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(jsonStr, 'youngunicornsrunfree');
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, ""youngunicornsrunfree"");
console.log(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

This gives us our answer jsonStr after we encrypt it then decrypt it. But say we want to send it to the server. We can do this easily by pulling out the encrypted string with toString(). Sounds to simple right? Say we need to send the encrypted jsonStr to the server. Try this
jsonStr = '{""something"":""else""}';
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(jsonStr, 'youngunicornsrunfree');
console.log(""We send this: ""+encrypted.toString());

Now say we sent something earlier and we are getting it back. We can do something like this:
var messageFromServer = ""U2FsdGVkX19kyHo1s8+EwNuo/LQdL3RnSoDHU2ovA88RtyOs+PvpQ1UZssMNfflTemaMAwHDbnWagA8lQki5kQ=="";

","You would need to serialize the ciphertext yourself. There are many ways to do it.
If the key is not a string, but a WordArray (as in your case), then a simple encryptedlogin.toString() would produce a Base64 encoded string only containing the ciphertext. Remember that you need to include the enc-base64.js source file.
If the ""key"" (actually password) is a string, then an OpenSSL-compatible key derivation is applied. In that case encryptedlogin.toString() would be a Base64 encoded string which contains the ""Salted__"" string, 8 byte random salt and the ciphertext.
If you only want to get the ciphertext then encryptedlogin.ciphertext.toString() will give you a Hex-encoded string which contains only the ciphertext and encryptedlogin.iv.toString() will give you a Hex-encoded IV. You can produce a Base64-encoded string in this way encryptedlogin.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64).
Remember that the IV must be randomly chosen for every encryption in order to provide semantic security. It doesn't have to be secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext.
On the server side, you would decode the values (Base64 or Hex depending on what you used during encryption) and use them with the AesCryptoServiceProvider class (or similar) to decrypt the ciphertext.

Remember that you additionally need to authenticate your ciphertext in order to detect (malicious) manipulation. This can be done with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme with a strong MAC like HMAC-SHA256.
Also, if the key is transmitted along with the ciphertext or over an insecure channel, then this is basically just data obfuscation and doesn't provide real security. See more: Javascript Cryptography Considered Harmful

","I too had the requirement to send encrypted JSON object to .Net CORE API 2.0 and searched on internet to find if there is any help. I know by now you would have solved this issue but to help anyone interested I am providing my solution to help them.
With the sample codes I found here on stackoverflow, I managed to implement the solution. The tricky bit is the key and IV has to be 16 in length for the code to work.
public static encrypt(model: any) {
        const key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('TestMyOwnKeyForI');
        const iv = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('TestMyOwnIV1ForI');
        // padding and truncating
        const encryptedMessage = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(model), key, {            
            keySize: 128 / 8,
            iv: iv,
            mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
        }).toString();

        return encryptedMessage;
}

In CORE I've implemented my customer model binding provider as follows:
public class DecryptModelBinderProvider : IModelBinderProvider
    {
        public IModelBinder GetBinder(ModelBinderProviderContext context)
        {
            if (context.Metadata.ModelType == typeof(MyModel))
                return new DecryptModelBinder();

            return null;
        }
    }

Then my own decryptmodelbinder as follows:
public class DecryptModelBinder : IModelBinder
    {
        public Task BindModelAsync(ModelBindingContext bindingContext)
        {
            if (bindingContext == null)
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(bindingContext));
            using (var sr = new StreamReader(bindingContext.HttpContext.Request.Body))
            {
                string valueFromBody = sr.ReadToEnd();

                if (valueFromBody != null && valueFromBody.Length > 0)
                {
                    var decrypted = Encryption.DecryptString(valueFromBody, ""TestMyOwnKeyForI"");

                    var model = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(decrypted, bindingContext.ModelType);

                    bindingContext.Result = ModelBindingResult.Success(model);
                    bindingContext.Model = model;        
                }

            }

","I know this question is quite old but I figured I'd share what I know anyways.
You can do this more easily by doing what I discuss in this answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/17848266/2226207
Basically you can include components/lib-typedarrays-min.js and then do the following in code.
var reader = new FileReader();

// If we use onloadend, we need to check the readyState.
reader.onloadend = function(evt) {
  if (evt.target.readyState == FileReader.DONE) { // DONE == 2

    var wordArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(e.target.result);
    var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(wordArray);
  }
};

var blob = file.slice(start, stop + 1);
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

I haven't tested the above solution but it should work fine.

","Here is a simple solution found : https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/issues/detail?id=62

When you pass a string to a hasher, it's converted to bytes using UTF-8. That's to ensure foreign characters are not clipped. Since you're working with binary data, you'll want to convert the string to bytes using Latin1.

sha256.update(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(evt.target.result));

The files (images) are encrypted in an iOS and Android app, sent to a server, and downloaded in this web app to be decrypted and displayed. The iOS and Android apps are able to decrypt the files without problems, so there's nothing wrong with the encryption process. 
The files are downloaded with an XMLHttpRequest with responseType set to arraybuffer. Here's my code so far:
// Decrypt a Base64 encrypted string (this works perfectly)
String.prototype.aesDecrypt = function(key) {

    var nkey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key.sha256());
    return CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(this.toString(), nkey, {

    });

    // Output is an empty WordList
    console.log(""Output: "", output);

}

Another question I have is how do you convert a WordArray to an ArrayBuffer?
","The conversion of ArrayBuffer -> WordArray has been discussed in CryptoJS's issue 46. For that reason a TypedWordArraywhere you can also pass an ArrayBuffer has been added.

To use that additionally include the following script:
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1/build/components/lib-typedarrays.js""></script>

Then you can simply do:
var wordArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(arrayBuffer);

/* perform decryption of `wordArray` */


To reconvert the resulting decryptedWordArray to an ArrayBuffer, the simplest approach would probably be, to first convert it to a Base64-String (as discussed here) and then decode that String to the desired ArrayBuffer (see here). The whole procedure would look something like this:
dcWordArray = ... // your decrypted WordArray
dcBase64String = dcWordArray.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64); // to Base64-String
dcArrayBuffer = base64DecToArr(dcBase64String).buffer; // to ArrayBuffer

Edit:
For a more efficient conversion (no intermediate Base64String necessary) check out Aletheios answer to that question (the function wordToByteArray(wordArray) and then do .buffer).

","you can use the web crypto API to directly decrypt arrayBuffer.
No need to convert binary data to a string, which is so inefficient, and it could cause memory and CPU rises.

","In addition to my comment up there.. it wouldn't have any difference storing regular or encrypted data.. since local storage only accepts text then if you're storing JSON for example it needs to be stringified first.. so before storing you stringify -> then encrypt -> then store.. and on retrieve you retrieve -> then decrypt -> then parse.
I've used CryptoJS once and that was for Hash calculation where I used to send the hashing salt via SMS.. and it was really working good. 
An example for encryption/decryption using for example AES is:

","The first hash value is identical to the third, except it is base64-encoded rather than hex-encoded. You can change to hex encoding and get the same value:
var hashed = CryptoJS.SHA512(base64Decoded).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);

The second approach you show has a different value because you are not hashing the same data; you are instead converting the byteArray to a hex string and then hashing that string representation, not the underlying values.

"40680431","How can I encrypt/decrypt arbitrary binary files using Javascript in the browser?","I need to let users load files from their system, encrypt them on-the-fly and upload to the server and do the opposite thing (download files from the server, decrypt on the fly and let the user save them locally). The exact crypto method is not very important although AES is preferred.
Links like Encryption / decryption of binary data in the browser just tell you ""use CryptoJS"" but I was unable to find any actually working samples. All samples I found focus on dealing with strings while in binary data you can easily find invalid Unicode sequences.
Is there any working sample I can test which can process files of any kind?
","Note: I won't explain how to decrypt the data, but that should be rather easy to figure out using the code for encryption and the documentation-links provided.
First of all, the user has to be able to select a file via an input element.
<input type=""file"" id=""file-upload"" onchange=""processFile(event)"">

You can then load the content of the file using the HTML5 FileReader API
function processFile(evt) {
    var file = evt.target.files[0],
        reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onload = function(e) {
        var data = e.target.result;

        // to be continued...
    }

    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);   
}

Encrypt the acquired data using the WebCrypto API.
If you don't want to randomly generate the key use crypto.subtle.deriveKey to create a key, for example, from a password that the user entered.
// [...]
var iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16)); // Generate a 16 byte long initialization vector

crypto.subtle.generateKey({ 'name': 'AES-CBC', 'length': 256 ]}, false, [ 'encrypt', 'decrypt' ])
    .then(key => crypto.subtle.encrypt({ 'name': 'AES-CBC', iv }, key, data))
    .then(encrypted => { /* ... */ });

Now you can send your encrypted data to the server (e.g. with AJAX).
Obviously you will also have to somehow store the Initialization Vector to later successfully decrypt everything.

Here is a little example which alerts the length of the encrypted data.
Note: If it says Only secure origins are allowed, reload the page with https and try the sample again (This is a restriction of the WebCrypto API):
HTTPS-Link


function processFile(evt) {
    var file = evt.target.files[0],
        reader = new FileReader();

    reader.onload = function(e) {
        var data = e.target.result,
            iv = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
      
        crypto.subtle.generateKey({ 'name': 'AES-CBC', 'length': 256 }, false, ['encrypt', 'decrypt'])
            .then(key => crypto.subtle.encrypt({ 'name': 'AES-CBC', iv }, key, data) )
            .then(encrypted => {
                console.log(encrypted);
                alert('The encrypted data is ' + encrypted.byteLength + ' bytes long'); // encrypted is an ArrayBuffer
            })

","What's the point of encrypting at the client and then decrypting at the server? This is not security, if all the information for encryption is client side, all someone needs to do is look at the JS source to see what your salt is, there is no security there.
The whole point is to send some data (over a secured channel, like https) to the server, then have the server hash it, and compare that hash to something you already have stored.
The security comes from what happens at the server, not from what you do to the data before you send it. A secure connection will prevent man-in-the-middle listening, but anything you have at the client is out in the open, and in no way contributes to security, unless you're using not-in-the-browser information (like having someone paste in their PGP public key along with whatever you send, with the server already knowing this person's PGP private key for authentication verification) in which case the actual data becomes irrelevant because the public key is now the important part...
So yeah, don't do this. It makes you believe you're being extra secure, when in fact you only made things worse.

","Well, here it is: a CryptoJS implementation of PHP's crypt for MD5-hashes (I guess it's too large to paste). So it's not a complete crypt-like thing but in your code example you are setting up a MD5-based hash (with the $1$ salt prefix).
How to use it: 

Store in a file named php-crypt-md5.js
Use it like that (""rollups"" is in your CryptoJS directory, just use the correct path):

<script src=""php-crypt-md5.js""></script>

From one web page, it tells me that JS has two way to encrypt password 
(reference link ):


a. crypto.createCipher(algorithm, password)
b. crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv)


What I saw in JavaScript should be option a. However, only option b is equivalent to AES.new() in python.
The questions are:

How can I restore this password in Python without changing JavaScript code? 
If I need IV in Python, how can I get it from the password that is used in JavaScript? 

","You will have to implement OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey, because that is what CryptoJS uses to derive the key and IV from the provided password, but pyCrypto only supports the key+IV type encryption. CryptoJS also generates a random salt which also must be send to the server. If the ciphertext object is converted to a string, then it uses automatically an OpenSSL-compatible format which includes the random salt.

CryptoJS defaults to 256 bit key size for AES, PKCS#7 padding and CBC mode. AES has a 128 bit block size which is also the IV size. This means that we have to request 32+16 = 48 byte from EVP_BytesToKey. I've found a semi-functional implementation here and extended it further.

"26066604","Generating unique tokens in a NodeJS, Crypto Token authentication environment","Using nodejs and crypto, right now, when a user logs in, I generate a random auth token:
var token = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');

I know it's unlikely, but there is a tiny chance for two tokens to be of the same value.
This means a user could, in theory, authenticate on another account.
Now, I see two obvious methods to get pass this:

When I generate the token, query the user's database and see if a
Token with the same value already exists. If it does, just generate another one. As you can see, this is not perfect since I am adding queries to the database.
Since every user has a unique username in my database, I could
generate a random token using the username as a secret generator key.
This way, there is no way of two tokens having the same value. Can crypto do that? Is it secure?

How would you do it?
","It's too unlikely to worry about it happening by chance. I would not sacrifice performance to lock and check the database for it.
Consider this excerpt from Pro Git about the chance of random collisions between 20-byte SHA-1 sums:

Here’s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a
  SHA-1 collision [by chance]. If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming,
  and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent
  of the entire Linux kernel history (1 million Git objects) and pushing
  it into one enormous Git repository, it would take 5 years until that
  repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a
  single SHA-1 object collision. A higher probability exists [for average projects] that every
  member of your programming team will be attacked and killed by wolves
  in unrelated incidents on the same night.

(SHA-1 collisions can be directly constructed now, so the quote is now less applicable to SHA-1, but it's still valid when considering collisions of random values.)
If you are still worried about that probability, then you can easily use more random bytes instead of 16.
But regarding your second idea: if you hashed the random ID with the username, then that hash could collide, just like the random ID could. You haven't solved anything.

How would you do it?
","You should always add a UNIQUE constraint to your database column. This will create an implicit index to improve searches for this column and it will make sure that none of two records will ever has the same value. So, in the worst-case scenario you will get a database exception and not a security violation.
Also, depending on how frequently unique tokens are needed to be created, I think it's perfectly fine in most cases to use database lookups during generation. If your column, again, is properly indexed, it will be a pretty fast query. Most databases a very well horizontally scalable, so if your are building a next Facebook it is again an option. Furthermore, you will probably need to do a query to check for E-Mail uniqueness anyway.
Finally, if you are really concerned about performance you could always pre-generate a one-million of unique tokens and store them in the separate database table for quick use. Just setup a routine to periodically check it's usage and insert more records to it as needed. However, as @MacroMan stated in the comments, this could have a security implications if someone will get access to the list of pre-generated tokens, so this practice should be avoided.

Assume we have an existing asp.net identity database with the default tables (aspnet_Users, aspnet_Roles, etc.). Based on my understanding, the password hashing algorithm uses sha256 and stores the salt + (hashed password) as a base64 encoded string. EDIT: This assumption is incorrect, see answer below.
I would like to replicate the function of the Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Crypto class' VerifyHashedPassword function with a JavaScript version. 
Let's say that a password is welcome1 and its asp.net hashed password is        ADOEtXqGCnWCuuc5UOAVIvMVJWjANOA/LoVy0E4XCyUHIfJ7dfSY0Id+uJ20DTtG+A==
So far I have been able to reproduce the parts of the method that get the salt and the stored sub key.
Where the C# implementation does more or less this:
var salt = new byte[SaltSize];
Buffer.BlockCopy(hashedPasswordBytes, 1, salt, 0, SaltSize);
var storedSubkey = new byte[PBKDF2SubkeyLength];
Buffer.BlockCopy(hashedPasswordBytes, 1 + SaltSize, storedSubkey, 0, PBKDF2SubkeyLength);

I have the following in JavaScript (not elegant by any stretch):
var hashedPwd = ""ADOEtXqGCnWCuuc5UOAVIvMVJWjANOA/LoVy0E4XCyUHIfJ7dfSY0Id+uJ20DTtG+A=="";
var hashedPasswordBytes = new Buffer(hashedPwd, 'base64');
var saltbytes = [];
var storedSubKeyBytes = [];

for(var i=1;i<hashedPasswordBytes.length;i++)
{
  if(i > 0 && i <= 16)
  {
    saltbytes.push(hashedPasswordBytes[i]);
  }
  if(i > 0 && i >16) {
    storedSubKeyBytes.push(hashedPasswordBytes[i]);
  }
}

Again, it ain't pretty, but after running this snippet the saltbytes and storedSubKeyBytes match byte for byte what I see in the C# debugger for salt and storedSubkey. 
Finally, in C#, an instance of Rfc2898DeriveBytes is used to generate a new subkey based on the salt and the password provided, like so:
byte[] generatedSubkey;
using (var deriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, PBKDF2IterCount))
{
   generatedSubkey = deriveBytes.GetBytes(PBKDF2SubkeyLength);
}

This is where I'm stuck. I have tried others' solutions such as this one, I have used Google's and Node's CryptoJS and crypto libraries respectively, and my output never generates anything resembling the C# version. 
(Example: 
var output = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(new Buffer('welcome1', 'utf16le'), 
    new Buffer(parsedSaltString), 1000, 32, 'sha256');
console.log(output.toString('base64'))

generates ""LSJvaDM9u7pXRfIS7QDFnmBPvsaN2z7FMXURGHIuqdY="")
Many of the pointers I've found online indicate problems involving encoding mismatches (NodeJS / UTF-8 vs. .NET / UTF-16LE), so I've tried encoding using the default .NET encoding format but to no avail.
Or I could be completely wrong about what I assume these libraries are doing. But any pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated.
","Ok, I think this problem ended up being quite a bit simpler than I was making it (aren't they always). After performing a RTFM operation on the pbkdf2 spec, I ran some side-by-side tests with Node crypto and .NET crypto, and have made pretty good progress on a solution. 
The following JavaScript code correctly parses the stored salt and subkey, then verifies the given password by hashing it with the stored salt. There are doubtless better / cleaner / more secure tweaks, so comments welcome.
// NodeJS implementation of crypto, I'm sure google's 
// cryptoJS would work equally well.

var storedSubKeyString = """";

// build strings of octets for the salt and the stored key

    if (i > 0 && i <= 16) {
        saltString += hexChar[(hashedPasswordBytes[i] >> 4) & 0x0f] + hexChar[hashedPasswordBytes[i] & 0x0f]
    }
    if (i > 0 && i > 16) {

Again, it ain't pretty, but after running this snippet the saltbytes and storedSubKeyBytes match byte for byte what I see in the C# debugger for salt and storedSubkey. 
Finally, in C#, an instance of Rfc2898DeriveBytes is used to generate a new subkey based on the salt and the password provided, like so:
byte[] generatedSubkey;
using (var deriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, PBKDF2IterCount))

}

This is where I'm stuck. I have tried others' solutions such as this one, I have used Google's and Node's CryptoJS and crypto libraries respectively, and my output never generates anything resembling the C# version. 
(Example: 
var output = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(new Buffer('welcome1', 'utf16le'), 
    new Buffer(parsedSaltString), 1000, 32, 'sha256');
console.log(output.toString('base64'))

Many of the pointers I've found online indicate problems involving encoding mismatches (NodeJS / UTF-8 vs. .NET / UTF-16LE), so I've tried encoding using the default .NET encoding format but to no avail.
Or I could be completely wrong about what I assume these libraries are doing. But any pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated.
","The previous solution will not work in all cases.
Let's say that you want to compare a password source against a hash in the database hash, which can be technically possible if the database is compromised, then the function will return true because the subkey is an empty string.
Modify the function to catch that up and return false instead.
// NodeJS implementation of crypto, I'm sure google's 
// cryptoJS would work equally well.
var crypto = require('crypto');

// The value stored in [dbo].[AspNetUsers].[PasswordHash]
var hashedPwd = ""ADOEtXqGCnWCuuc5UOAVIvMVJWjANOA/LoVy0E4XCyUHIfJ7dfSY0Id+uJ20DTtG+A=="";
var hashedPasswordBytes = new Buffer(hashedPwd, 'base64');

var hexChar = [""0"", ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F""];

var saltString = """";
var storedSubKeyString = """";

// build strings of octets for the salt and the stored key
for (var i = 1; i < hashedPasswordBytes.length; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && i <= 16) {
        saltString += hexChar[(hashedPasswordBytes[i] >> 4) & 0x0f] + hexChar[hashedPasswordBytes[i] & 0x0f]
    }
    if (i > 0 && i > 16) {
        storedSubKeyString += hexChar[(hashedPasswordBytes[i] >> 4) & 0x0f] + hexChar[hashedPasswordBytes[i] & 0x0f];
    }
}

if (storedSubKeyString === '') { return false }

// password provided by the user
var password = 'welcome1';

// TODO remove debug - logging passwords in prod is considered 
// tasteless for some odd reason
console.log('cleartext: ' + password);
console.log('saltString: ' + saltString);
console.log('storedSubKeyString: ' + storedSubKeyString);

// This is where the magic happens. 
// If you are doing your own hashing, you can (and maybe should)
// perform more iterations of applying the salt and perhaps
// use a stronger hash than sha1, but if you want it to work
// with the [as of 2015] Microsoft Identity framework, keep
// these settings.
var nodeCrypto = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(new Buffer(password), new Buffer(saltString, 'hex'), 1000, 256, 'sha1');

// get a hex string of the derived bytes
var derivedKeyOctets = nodeCrypto.toString('hex').toUpperCase();

console.log(""hex of derived key octets: "" + derivedKeyOctets);

const crypto = require('crypto');

const password = 'Password123';
const storedHashString = 'J9IBFSw0U1EFsH/ysL+wak6wb8s=';

1000 is the default number of iterations in System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes and 20 is the number of bytes we are using to store the salt (again the default).

Assuming that you are using the viewer.html of PDF.js, opening a PDF file from data is as easy as calling PDFViewerApplication.open with the right parameters.
Example: Typed arrays (Uint8Array / ArrayBuffer / ..)
// in viewer.html
var data = new Uint8Array( /* ... data ... */ );
PDFViewerApplication.open(data);

Example: Blob / File objects
// in viewer.html
var data = new Blob([ '%PDF....'] , {type: 'application/pdf'});
var url = URL.createObjectURL(data);
PDFViewerApplication.open(url);

Example: data URL (if supported by browser)
var url = 'data:application/pdf;base64,....';
PDFViewerApplication.open(url);

Example: data URL (any browser)
This consists of two steps: Decoding the base64 data-URL, and then converting the binary string to an Uint8Array.
var url = 'data:application/pdf;base64,....';
var data = url.split(';base64,')[1];
// Decode base64
var binaryString = atob(data);
// Convert binary string to Uint8Array
data = new Uint8Array(binaryString.length);
for (var i = 0, ii = binaryString.length; i < ii; ++i) {
    data[i] = binaryString.charCodeAt(i);
}
PDFViewerApplication.open(data);

Example: Using PDF.js in a frame
<iframe src=""viewer.html"" id=""pdfjsframe""></iframe>
<script>
var pdfjsframe = document.getElementById('pdfjsframe');
// At the very least, wait until the frame is ready, e.g via onload.
pdfjsframe.onload = function() {
    var data = ... data here or elsewhere ... ;
    pdfjsframe.contentWindow.PDFViewerApplication.open(data);

","Using laravel 5.1 and CryptoJS which can be found at (https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/). 
in .env set:

APP_KEY=uberkeythatrocks

in config/app.php set:

'cipher' => 'AES-256-CBC'

in MyController.php:

$mySecret = ""Something I wanna hide from them"";
$encrypted = Crypt::encrypt($mySecret);

in index.js:

var key = ""uberkeythatrocks"";
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key);
var readable = decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

IMPORTANT:
The 'key' in PHP must be the same with 'key' in JS and the 'cipher' in PHP must be the same in JS however, CryptoJS will automatically select either AES-128-CBC or AES-256-CBC depending on the length of your 'key'. Although laravel 5.1 default 'cipher' is AES-256-CBC so I would suggest you get your 'key' from .env file to use in JS.
To change or generate a new 'key' from Laravel

C:/mylaravel> php artisan key:generate [enter]

To use AES-128-CBC

Edit config/app.php and set 'cipher' => 'AES-128-CBC'

then

C:/mylaravel> php artisan key:generate [enter]

NOTE that the change of 'key' will mean that an existing user account login password will not work unless you delete the user and then create new.
HOPE THIS HELPS! :)

   var message = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext, password, { mode:    CryptoJS.mode.CBC, iv: password });

","You have three issues:

CryptoJS supports two types of encryption/decryption: key derived from a password and directly passed key. You want to do this from a key, so you need to parse the hex-encoded key string into CryptoJS' native format before passing it to the decrypt() function:
key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key);

Also, don't confuse a key with a password.
You forgot to slice off the IV from the ciphertext before decrypting.
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(ciphertext.slice(0, 32));
ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(ciphertext.slice(32));

CryptoJS' expects either a CipherParams object or an OpenSSL-formatted string to decrypt from. Since you only have a hex string, you have to parse it before use and use it like this:
var message = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({
    ciphertext: ciphertext
}, key, {
    iv: iv
});

","SOLVED
Note: I found out that ""MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256"" in PHP's mcrypt is NOT included in AES. It uses the Rijndael method, BUT with a 256-bit block size (not included in AES). So, CryptoJS does not handle 256-bit block sizes for Rijndael. Thanks, GregS
Nonetheless, I found an implementation that successfully decrypted the ciphertext I get from running my PHP mcrypt function above, using MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 (Rijndael, 256-bit block size, with 256-bit key/32-byte key).
Here it is:
https://code.google.com/p/js-mcrypt/
<script>
var encrypted = 'nYoFAiyDARVSI09lH/IPdim5TvE51izVjk6sc2AK9Rg=';
var key = 'd4b494e4502a62edd695a903a94c2701';

var decrypted = mcrypt.Decrypt(atob(encrypted), iv, key, 'rijndael-256', 'cbc');

I hope this helps someone as I spent a week of my spare time trying to figure this out and almost giving up.

I need to migrate this code to Nodejs and facing multiple issues. I refeered http://mygo.iteye.com/blog/2018882 to get the basic idea on nodejs way to do the encryption in des3. However I see following difference in JAVA way and Nodejs way.
1. JAVA is using Hex string of 48 lenght as key, since one char in hex is 4 bits therfore final size is equivalent to 24 bytes length which meets DES3 requirement. 
2. In Java code, final key is being used as bytes (as needed by DES) which made indpendent of the way we store the key
3. In node js, key is stored as character i.e. to use des3 I have to use 24 bytes which is equivalent to 24 chars key as  73AD9CEC99816AA6A4D82FB2. Here this is string of 24 chars and since one char is one byte thereofore total length is 24 bytes which meets DES3 requirement.
4. Following is nodejs code for reference

    console.log(alg, txt);
    return txt;
}

Following is my problem.
1. How can i convert my existing hex code into string? I used ""hexToString"" method (please check the java code)to convert hex into string. However getting weired character (this is also expected but problem is how i can use this transformed key in nodejs.
2. Can I pass byte array as key to Nodejs? It will make problem easy as I can easily convert my hex key into bytes array and I store my bytes array key in nodejs code.
3. In my javacode, I have custom padding logic, how can i write same logic in nodejs?
4. Most importantly, can I achieve same encryption logic in nodejs (similar to java)?

Artjom B. helped me to get the insight of nodejs and des3 algorithm. I have edited my post to clarify my exact requirement.
I think my main problem is, how can i feed byte[] as key to nodejs crypto for DES3?
I am kind of stuck. Please help.
","Running crypto.getCiphers() shows you the available ciphers. Triple DES (EDE) in ECB mode with two keys (16 byte key) can be used as des-ede. If you have three part key (24 byte key) you should use des-ede3. ecb probably does not appear in the cipher description, because it's the most basic form.
Triple DES-EDE has different ways to use a key. EDE means encrypt-decrypt-encrypt with three different keys. If you only have for example one 8 byte key, this suggests that you use the same key for every phase of EDE. It's clear from your Java code that you have a 24 byte key (48 hex encoded chars). You have to use the same key.
The crypto module uses PKCS7 padding by default, so you will need to set the auto padding to false and do the padding yourself. I leave that task up to you.

Word of caution:
Don't use (3)DES especially with only one 8 byte key! Don't use ECB mode! Don't use NoPadding for block modes! Use AES-256 with GCM mode (no padding since it's a streaming mode).-

I need to migrate this code to Nodejs and facing multiple issues. I refeered http://mygo.iteye.com/blog/2018882 to get the basic idea on nodejs way to do the encryption in des3. However I see following difference in JAVA way and Nodejs way.
1. JAVA is using Hex string of 48 lenght as key, since one char in hex is 4 bits therfore final size is equivalent to 24 bytes length which meets DES3 requirement. 
2. In Java code, final key is being used as bytes (as needed by DES) which made indpendent of the way we store the key
3. In node js, key is stored as character i.e. to use des3 I have to use 24 bytes which is equivalent to 24 chars key as  73AD9CEC99816AA6A4D82FB2. Here this is string of 24 chars and since one char is one byte thereofore total length is 24 bytes which meets DES3 requirement.
4. Following is nodejs code for reference

    var cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(alg, key, iv);
    cipher.setAutoPadding(autoPad);  //default true  
    var ciph = cipher.update(plaintext, 'utf8', 'hex');
    ciph += cipher.final('hex');

    return ciph;

}

    console.log(alg, txt);
    return txt;
}

Following is my problem.
1. How can i convert my existing hex code into string? I used ""hexToString"" method (please check the java code)to convert hex into string. However getting weired character (this is also expected but problem is how i can use this transformed key in nodejs.
2. Can I pass byte array as key to Nodejs? It will make problem easy as I can easily convert my hex key into bytes array and I store my bytes array key in nodejs code.
3. In my javacode, I have custom padding logic, how can i write same logic in nodejs?
4. Most importantly, can I achieve same encryption logic in nodejs (similar to java)?

Artjom B. helped me to get the insight of nodejs and des3 algorithm. I have edited my post to clarify my exact requirement.
I think my main problem is, how can i feed byte[] as key to nodejs crypto for DES3?
I am kind of stuck. Please help.

What I am doing wrong ?
Is it focusing on AES is a best idea - I will be happy if I have some kind of encryption that will blur data. 
","There are many problems with your Python code and CryptoJS code:

You use a random IV to encrypt some plaintext in Python. If you want to retrieve that plaintext, you need to use the same IV during decryption. The plaintext cannot be recovered without the IV. Usually the IV is simply prepended to the ciphertext, because it doesn't have to be secret. So you need to read the IV during decryption and not generate a new one.
You use CBC mode in CryptoJS (default) instead of CFB mode. The mode has to be the same. The other tricky part is that CFB mode is parametrized with a segment size. PyCrypto uses by default 8-bit segments (CFB8), but CryptoJS is only implemented for fixed segments of 128-bit (CFB128). Since the PyCrypto version is variable, you need to change that.
The CryptoJS decrypt() function expects as ciphertext either an OpenSSL formatted string or a CipherParams object. Since you don't have an OpenSSL formatted string, you have to convert the ciphertext into an object.
The key for CryptoJS is expected to be a WordArray and not a string.
Use the same padding. PyCrypto doesn't pad the plaintext if CFB8 is used, but padding is needed when CFB128 is used. CryptoJS uses PKCS#7 padding by default, so you only need to implement that padding in python.

Python code (for version 2):
def pad(data):
    length = 16 - (len(data) % 16)
    return data + chr(length)*length

def unpad(data):
    return data[:-ord(data[-1])]

def encrypt(message, passphrase):
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CFB, IV, segment_size=128)
    return base64.b64encode(IV + aes.encrypt(pad(message)))

def decrypt(encrypted, passphrase):
    encrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted)
    IV = encrypted[:BLOCK_SIZE]
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CFB, IV, segment_size=128)
    return unpad(aes.decrypt(encrypted[BLOCK_SIZE:]))

JavaScript code:
<script src=""https://cdn.rawgit.com/CryptoStore/crypto-js/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>
<script src=""https://cdn.rawgit.com/CryptoStore/crypto-js/3.1.2/build/components/mode-cfb-min.js""></script>

    var base64ciphertextFromPython = ""..."";
    var ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64ciphertextFromPython);

    var iv = ciphertext.clone();
    iv.sigBytes = 16;
    iv.clamp();
    ciphertext.words.splice(0, 4); // delete 4 words = 16 bytes
    ciphertext.sigBytes -= 16;

    var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""1234567890123456"");

Other considerations:
It seems that you want to use a passphrase as a key. Passphrases are usually human readable, but keys are not. You can derive a key from a passphrase with functions such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.
The code above is not fully secure, because it lacks authentication. Unauthenticated ciphertexts may lead to viable attacks and unnoticed data manipulation. Usually the an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is employed with a good MAC function such as HMAC-SHA256.

","(1 Year later but I hope this works for someone)
First of all, thanks Artjom B. your post helps me a lot. And Like OP, I have the same same problem Python server endonding and Javascript client decoding. This was my solution:

Python 3.x (Server)
I used an excplicit PKCS7 encode for padding, why? because I want to be sure Im using the same padding enconding and decoding, this is the link where I found it http://programmerin.blogspot.com.co/2011/08/python-padding-with-pkcs7.html .
Then, like Artjom B. said, be sure about your segment size, IV size and AES mode (CBC for me),
This is the code:
def encrypt_val(clear_text):
    master_key = '1234567890123456' 
    encoder = PKCS7Encoder()
    raw = encoder.encode(clear_text)
    iv = Random.new().read( 16 )
    cipher = AES.new( master_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv, segment_size=128 )
    return base64.b64encode( iv + cipher.encrypt( raw ) ) 

Note than your are enconding on base64 the concatenation of IV and encryption data.

Javascript (client)
function decryptMsg (data) {
    master_key = '1234567890123456';

    // Decode the base64 data so we can separate iv and crypt text.
    var rawData = atob(data);
    // Split by 16 because my IV size
    var iv = rawData.substring(0, 16);
    var crypttext = rawData.substring(16);

    //Parsers
    crypttext = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(crypttext);
    iv = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(iv); 
    key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(master_key);

    // Decrypt
    var plaintextArray = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
      { ciphertext:  crypttext},
      key,
      {iv: iv, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7}
    );

    // Can be Utf8 too
    output_plaintext = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.stringify(plaintextArray);
    console.log(""plain text : "" + output_plaintext);
}

One of my main problem was keep in mind all kind of encoding and decoding data, for example, I didn't know that the master_key on client side was to be parse with Utf8.

","CryptoJS expects the ciphertext to be a CipherParams object or an OpenSSL-encoded string. You've passed in the ciphertext as Hex. Do this instead:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.TripleDES.decrypt({
    ciphertext: CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('723024D59CF7801A295F81B9D5BB616E')
}, key, { 
    iv : iv, 
    mode:CryptoJS.mode.CBC
});

decrypted is now a WordArray object. Stringifying it leads to a string with the default encoding which is Hex. If you know that you should get text out, you can use the appropriate encoding like:
console.log(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

","The answer by Artjom B works, but is problematic if used with a static IV. The IV (and SALT) should change from message to message. And trying to create and send non-static IV / SALTS between different languages/libraries can be difficult.
So, as I was struggling also with exchanging encrypted texts between C# and JS I took the time to solve that once and for all and wrote a small library and published it under the MIT license for everyone to use. 
The ciphertext is in base64 and combined by "":"" with the base64-SALT and the base64-IV
These are the steps to use it:
Use the library from https://github.com/smartinmedia/Net-Core-JS-Encryption-Decryption
For C#: 
    //Encrypt plain text in C# with a random password
    string plainText = ""This is my secret text!"";
    //You can also use the built in password generator!!
    //string passPhrase = PasswordGenerator.GenerateRandomPassword(20);
    //Or use your own password:        
    string passPhrase = ""This_is_my_password!"";

    var enc = EncryptionHandler.Encrypt(plainText, passPhrase);
    Console.WriteLine(""Plaintext: 'This is my secret text' with password 'This_is_my_password!' results in ciphertext: "" + enc);

    var dec3 = EncryptionHandler.Decrypt(enc, passPhrase);
    Console.WriteLine(""And decrypting again: "" + dec3);
    Console.WriteLine(""Please start the index.html to see the same in Javascript. Encryption / Decryption run in both ways and can be interchanged between C# and JS!"");

For JS:
// This is the ciphertext, which was encrypted by C# to check the interchangeability:
    var encryptedBase64FromCSharp = ""uTkXNB+PSTjzwUCJbfAHVHd95YOlcJr38wbF08ZxqNw=:PNGRjWb5tOINneaVVf8+cw==:Aic+gosvLjTrCebzY8l/usTh+kWuE0v1xSWw7apYunI="";
    var passPhrase = ""This_is_my_password!"";

    var eH = new encryptionHandler();

    var decryptedFromCSharp = eH.decrypt(encryptedBase64FromCSharp, passPhrase);

    //Now encrypt again with JS
    var encryptTextWithJs = eH.encrypt(decryptedFromCSharp, ""This_is_my_password!"");
    //And decrypt again with JS
    var decryptedTextWithJs = eH.decrypt(encryptTextWithJs, ""This_is_my_password!"");

So, as you can see here, the ciphertexts can be exchanged between C# and JS with randomly generated SALTs and IVs (which are generated in the methods encrypt/decrypt).

","accounts-password actually takes care of this for you. I wish the documentation of the implementation details was better, but you can see an overview here.
Passwords are verified by examining hashes, so only a hashed version of the passed from the client to the server which is then run through bcrypt.
client: password --> network: sha256(password) --> server: bcrypt(sha256(password))
What's nice about this implementation is: (a) the server never sees or stores password-equivalent data, (b) it's all done for you just by installing the package.

But i quite don't know how to decrypt it. I'm tried some code from google search but it end up wrong padding if use DESese or get wrong value if i use ECB/NoPadding. 
I did try to something like setting sfg for CryptoJS side like:

But they got javascript exception ( a is not define )

","According to the documentation, your encryptedString variable contains structured data that must be split apart to be sent to Java code. You will need to send encryptedString.iv and encryptedString.ciphertext to your Java code. If you continue to use passwords (see below), you will need to send encryptedString.salt as well.
If you pass your key as a string it will be interpreted as a password and a key will be derived from it. If you actually want to pass an explicit key, follow the documentation and specify the IV and key as suggested by the code snippet below. If you stick with supplying a password, then you must figure out the derivation scheme and use the same process in your Java code.
// Code snippet from http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#Custom_Key_and_IV
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>

    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", key, { iv: iv });
</script>

Regarding your Java code, it looks mostly OK (although there is plenty of room for error with string conversions). However, you probably want to convert your key from hex to binary rather than grabbing the bytes:
byte[] keyAsBytes = DatatypeConverter.parseHexBinary(myEncryptionKey);

This assumes you alter your JavaScript code to pass the literal key value.
You will also need to switch to DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding and pass an IVParameterSpec object to your Cipher.init call, specifying the IV value sent from your Java Script code.

The first parameter has to be an object or a base64-encoded JavaScript string. Passing just encrypted makes the decrypt call silently fail. You can either do what I have above or remove the following line from your to leave the ciphertext as a base64-encoded JavaScript string:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(encrypted);

JavaScript in general has very strange support for byte arrays, so the CryptoJS wrappers are required for everything to work properly. Even secretThree, which is entirely ASCII [0-9a-f].

","If you want to supply the key directly you should supply IV too. The IV (initialization vector) is needed so it can be XOR'ed with the 1st block of the message. Then the ciphertext of the first block is XOR'ed  with the 2nd block of the message and so on. This is called cipher-block chaining (CBC).

The CryptoJS wiki does not mention this parameter at all.
And yet, it works. I can decrypt with this : 
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, 'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M', key, {iv: iv});

If I omit 'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M' in the decrypt() call, it won't work.
So that parameter really does something. But what? Is is a hash, a salt? 
Does anybody know how I can replicate this specific encryption process with PHP?
I can not modify this JS code in any way.
The code is on a login page and is used to encrypt credentials before they are sent to the server.
I am trying to use PHP-cURL to submit credentials to that server from the command line, which is why I need to reproduce this encryption process.
Update: thanks to Jim's answer, I now have the proper JavaScript, now I need help with replicating the code in PHP
Here is the JS : 
var plaintext = 'test';
var key = 'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M';
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('r0dkbnVQhklNeUGA');
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, key, key,{iv: iv,mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7})

encrypted equals U2FsdGVkX1+ZujoXKqDHcO+4N1QO+Nv1KHUMFjZos1s=
Here is the decryption:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key);

decrypted equals test
I have tried many different ways to replicate the encryption with PHP, but none of them gives a a string I can decode with the above JS.
For instance, using this AES_Encryption class, I tried the following code : 
$key = 'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M';
$iv =  'r0dkbnVQhklNeUGA';
$message = 'test';
$AES              = new AES_Encryption($key, $iv, PKCS7);
$encrypted        = $AES->encrypt($message);
$decrypted        = $AES->decrypt($encrypted);
$base64_encrypted = base64_encode('Salted__'.$encrypted);

I end up with U2FsdGVkX18eEv+TnigBEKGJL8t/V1Hm instead of U2FsdGVkX1+ZujoXKqDHcO+4N1QO+Nv1KHUMFjZos1s=
Note that both strings start the same way, thanks to the 'Salted__' prefix I added (since CryptoJS seems to do the same thing).
I tried similar code with phpseclib, openssl_encrypt and mcrypt. No luck.
Any hint would be appreciated.
**Update: FIXED **
This PHP code is a perfect match for the CryptoJS code above.

","This is a JavaScript thing, not a CryptoJS thing. Try this:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, 'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M', {iv: iv});

or this:
key = 'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M';
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key, {iv: iv});

You'll see that what you think is the key, isn't the key at all. It's being grouped with the optional parameters at the end, and lost.
'euhe68vjdr1aX4F091c7aCggSMBf0A7M' is your key, or is what your key is derived from.

var stringToEncode = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bArr);

I encrypt it with CryptoJS and then decrypt. First 25 bytes before encryption:
11,0,1,0,0,0,6,100,105,103,101,115,116,11,0,2,0,0,0,152,67,119,65,66,65

After the decryption:
11,0,1,0,0,0,6,100,105,103,101,115,116,11,0,2,0,0,0,194,152,67,119,65,66

The only difference is an additional 194 at position 20. All other bytes are exactly the same, except of padding, obviously. I'm trying to understand where is this coming from.
More info regarding hat are these bytes. This is a Thrift structure with 3 fields, field 2 contains a Base64 representation of another, embedded Thrift struct. First 20 bytes of input exmplained:

11,0,1: Thrift field of type string, fid 1
0,0,0,6: int32 length of the value of fid 1
100,67,119,65,66,65: string ""digest""
11,0,2: Thrift field of type string, fid 2
0,0,0,152: int32 length of the value of fid 2
67 ... until next byte 11: Base64 representation of the embedded struct

Because of the decryption issue Thrift parser incorrectly recognises the length of fid 2 value.
I believe I am using AES256 CBC with a 32 byte key (SHA256) and 16 byte IV in OpenSSL mode with PKCS7 padding.
This is my qunit test.

","The issue is that CryptoJS treats the input as UTF-8 input string unless it is already a WordArray. This is of course a problem if your input isn't UTF-8. What you are seeing is that the value above 0x80 (128) is converted into two bytes to fix the UTF-8 encoding.
You could use a direct conversion to hex and then to WordArray as long as WordArray does not support direct conversion from arrays to WordArray. It's a bit strange that this feature is missing.
The following converts an array with unsigned byte values to hexadecimals (with a bit of a guard with regard to invalid byte values):
function tohex(unsignedByteArray) {
    var hex = """";
    for (var i = 0; i < unsignedByteArray.length; i++) {
        var c = unsignedByteArray[i];
        if (c < 0 || c > 255) {
            throw ""Value not an unsigned byte in array"";
        }
        var h = c.toString(16);
        if (h.length == 1) {
            hex += ""0"" + h;
        } else {
            hex += h;
        }
    }
    return hex;
}

function fromhex(hex) {
    if (hex.length % 2 !== 0) {
        throw ""Hex string should contain even number of hex digits, one per byte"";
    }
    var unsignedByteArray = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < hex.length; i = i + 2) {
        var h = hex.substring(i, i + 2);
        if (!/^[0-9a-f]{2}$/i.test(h)) {
            throw ""Invalid hexdigit at offset "" + i;
        }
        var c = parseInt(h, 16);
        unsignedByteArray[unsignedByteArray.length] = c;
    }
    return unsignedByteArray;
}

So you would be able to use these functions like this:
var bArr = [11, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 100, 105, 103, 101, 115, 116, 11, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 152, 67, 119, 65, 66, 65, 65, 65, 65, 69, 109, 78, 111, 99, 109, 57, 116, 90, 83, 49, 48, 90, 88, 78, 48, 76, 87, 78, 115, 97, 87, 86, 117, 100, 65, 103, 65, 65, 103, 65, 65, 49, 68, 69, 75, 65, 65, 77, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 86, 75, 102, 66, 85, 103, 115, 65, 66, 65, 65, 65, 65, 67, 81, 49, 90, 68, 99, 119, 77, 71, 73, 120, 78, 67, 48, 121, 78, 84, 90, 107, 76, 84, 81, 119, 77, 109, 81, 116, 79, 84, 65, 48, 90, 105, 48, 52, 79, 84, 86, 105, 78, 68, 73, 50, 89, 109, 78, 108, 78, 84, 99, 76, 65, 65, 85, 65, 65, 65, 65, 85, 89, 50, 104, 121, 98, 50, 49, 108, 76, 87, 78, 115, 97, 87, 86, 117, 100, 67, 49, 122, 90, 87, 78, 121, 90, 88, 81, 65, 11, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 36, 52, 51, 52, 55, 54, 56, 98, 53, 45, 50, 48, 102, 102, 45, 52, 99, 100, 102, 45, 56, 53, 97, 50, 45, 57, 49, 49, 56, 50, 98, 55, 98, 51, 102, 57, 53, 0];
var bArrHex = tohex(bArr);

var stringToEncode = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(bArrHex);

var symmetricKey = ""v3JElaRswYgxOt4b"";

var key = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.stringify(CryptoJS.SHA256(symmetricKey)));

var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(stringToEncode, key, { iv: iv, format: CryptoJS.format.OpenSSL });

var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key, { iv: iv, format: CryptoJS.format.OpenSSL });

var result = fromhex(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex));

console.log(result);

if (bArr.toString() == result.toString()) {
    console.log(""success"");
}

Note that the encrypted automatically encodes to base64 when used as a string. You cannot use Latin1 encoding for ciphertext. Note that your key should also contain random bytes, not only printable characters as it does now.
Finally note that sending AES encrypted text without MAC is inherently unsafe, for instance because of padding oracle attacks and the fact that anybody can change the data in transit.

var bArr = [11,0,1,0,0,0,6,100,105,103,101,115,116,11,0,2,0,0,0,152,67,119,65,66,65,65,65,65,69,109,78,111,99,109,57,116,90,83,49,48,90,88,78,48,76,87,78,115,97,87,86,117,100,65,103,65,65,103,65,65,49,68,69,75,65,65,77,65,65,65,65,65,86,75,102,66,85,103,115,65,66,65,65,65,65,67,81,49,90,68,99,119,77,71,73,120,78,67,48,121,78,84,90,107,76,84,81,119,77,109,81,116,79,84,65,48,90,105,48,52,79,84,86,105,78,68,73,50,89,109,78,108,78,84,99,76,65,65,85,65,65,65,65,85,89,50,104,121,98,50,49,108,76,87,78,115,97,87,86,117,100,67,49,122,90,87,78,121,90,88,81,65,11,0,3,0,0,0,36,52,51,52,55,54,56,98,53,45,50,48,102,102,45,52,99,100,102,45,56,53,97,50,45,57,49,49,56,50,98,55,98,51,102,57,53,0];
var stringToEncode = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bArr);

I encrypt it with CryptoJS and then decrypt. First 25 bytes before encryption:
11,0,1,0,0,0,6,100,105,103,101,115,116,11,0,2,0,0,0,152,67,119,65,66,65

After the decryption:
11,0,1,0,0,0,6,100,105,103,101,115,116,11,0,2,0,0,0,194,152,67,119,65,66

The only difference is an additional 194 at position 20. All other bytes are exactly the same, except of padding, obviously. I'm trying to understand where is this coming from.
More info regarding hat are these bytes. This is a Thrift structure with 3 fields, field 2 contains a Base64 representation of another, embedded Thrift struct. First 20 bytes of input exmplained:

11,0,1: Thrift field of type string, fid 1
0,0,0,6: int32 length of the value of fid 1
100,67,119,65,66,65: string ""digest""
11,0,2: Thrift field of type string, fid 2
0,0,0,152: int32 length of the value of fid 2
67 ... until next byte 11: Base64 representation of the embedded struct

Because of the decryption issue Thrift parser incorrectly recognises the length of fid 2 value.
I believe I am using AES256 CBC with a 32 byte key (SHA256) and 16 byte IV in OpenSSL mode with PKCS7 padding.
This is my qunit test.

","Just as an additional reference. The accepted answer contains a key to the problem.
The issue is that CryptoJS treats the input as UTF-8 input string unless it is already a WordArray.
Indeed, I have changed my test to the following:
test(""Decryption"", function() {
  var bArr = [11,0,1,0,0,0,6,100,105,103,101,115,116,11,0,2,0,0,0,152,67,119,65,66,65,65,65,65,69,109,78,111,99,109,57,116,90,83,49,48,90,88,78,48,76,87,78,115,97,87,86,117,100,65,103,65,65,103,65,65,49,68,69,75,65,65,77,65,65,65,65,65,86,75,102,66,85,103,115,65,66,65,65,65,65,67,81,49,90,68,99,119,77,71,73,120,78,67,48,121,78,84,90,107,76,84,81,119,77,109,81,116,79,84,65,48,90,105,48,52,79,84,86,105,78,68,73,50,89,109,78,108,78,84,99,76,65,65,85,65,65,65,65,85,89,50,104,121,98,50,49,108,76,87,78,115,97,87,86,117,100,67,49,122,90,87,78,121,90,88,81,65,11,0,3,0,0,0,36,52,51,52,55,54,56,98,53,45,50,48,102,102,45,52,99,100,102,45,56,53,97,50,45,57,49,49,56,50,98,55,98,51,102,57,53,0];

                                      ).ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1);

  var decrypted = toByteArray( CryptoJS.AES.decrypt( { ciphertext: CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(encrypted) },
                                          key,

function toCryptoJSWordArray(bArr) {
  var latin1StrLength = bArr.length;
  // Convert
  var words = [];

This creates a WordArray from my bytearray and then encrypts and decrypts. The decrypted data comes back correctly.

","The AES and base64 are parts of CryptoJS already. No need to include more scripts.
From the project's github page:
var CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");

// Encrypt
var ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('my message', 'secret key 123');

// Decrypt
var bytes  = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext.toString(), 'secret key 123');
var plaintext = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

console.log(plaintext);

To use with requireJS:
require.config({
    packages: [
        {
            name: 'crypto-js',
            location: 'path-to/bower_components/crypto-js',
            main: 'index'
        }
    ]
});

You'll need to change the location to the path of the crypto-js distribution. Also, you should change your use of cryptoJS like so
require([""crypto-js""], function (CryptoJS) {
    // Encrypt
    var ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('my message', 'secret key 123');

    // Decrypt
    var bytes  = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext.toString(), 'secret key 123');
    var plaintext = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

    console.log(plaintext);

npm install crypto-browserify@3.11.0

EDIT 1: For reasons I don't quite grasp, this only fixed the problem temporarily. As soon as I restarted webpack, it stopped working again.
EDIT 2: This happens only in one of my projects, which is rather complex, so it's hard to pin down exactly what the differences are between the two, but as a temporary fix, you can just declare the variable:
window._crypto = null;

It's not pretty, but hopefully this will be temporary.

","I've had the same problem, and found the reason.
As you use webpack 1.x, the node-libs-browser@7.0 with crypto-browserify@3.3.0 (maybe earlier) will be installed at the same time.
So, if you just require('crypto') directly, webpack will use the @3.3.0, which has the rng.js, and not the newest version you installed by yourself.

The solution I tried is just npm install node-libs-browser --save, and npm will update it in webpack, and @3.11.0 will be found.

"39607485","SHA256 in React Native","I need to calculate SHA256 hash value of many files in Android and iOS using React Native.  When files are selected by a user, my app will start calculating SHA256 for each file.
For web pages, I have been using crypto-js.  But for Andoid and iOS applications, I am concerned that performance of crypto-js may not be fast enough as a file (eg. video file) may be >400 MB.  
Is there any way that I can call Android/iOS native api to calculate SHA256, instead of using crypto-js for performance sake?
","There isn't anything built into react-native itself to natively calculate a sha-256, but there are a few options.
As @Morre pointed out, react-native-sha256 is an open source project that supports calculating the sha-256 of a string using native components.
Another open source react-native project - react-native-fs - has support for calculating the sha-256 of a file using native components, specifically the hash function.
As @Morre has pointed out, you could write your own native code to provide the same functionality if you would prefer that option. Both of the libraries I mentioned here are open source, so the source code there can be a good reference for what the specific Android/iOS code would need to be written. There are also code examples here on StackOverflow for both java and swift. React-Native's native module documentation (Android) and iOS is extensive.

I want to encrypt that data of course, and my app already use CryptoJS.
As I understood, first I need to generate encryption_key by password using PBKDF2, and then just encrypt CryptoJS.AES.
Example code:
function generateKey(p){
var salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
return CryptoJS.PBKDF2(p, salt, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: 1000 });     
}

var pass = ""test1""; 
var iv  = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
key512Bits1000Iterations = generateKey(pass);
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", key512Bits1000Iterations, { iv: iv });
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key512Bits1000Iterations, { iv: iv });

//decrypting with another key step
key512Bits1000Iterations2 = generateKey(pass);
var decrypted2 = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key512Bits1000Iterations2, { iv: iv });
console.log(""decrypted "" + decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));
console.log(""decrypted2 "" + decrypted2.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

Dynamic salt and iv are used.
But when I second time generate key for decryption by same password I'm getting wrong result.(decrypted2 is empty)
So I want to ask, what I should store between encryption sessions, 
salt and iv to ?(but as I understood it should be dynamic )
Thanks!
","You are generating a new salt in generateKey(...). This makes PBKDF2 derived a new key.
function generateKey(p){
    var salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
    return CryptoJS.PBKDF2(p, salt, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: 1000 });     
}

You would need to store the salt and iv between sessions. These two values don't need to be secret.

","Not definitely an answer yet but too much for comments:
Commandline openssl enc by default uses password-based encryption (PBE) with salt, which means the actual encryption key, and IV when applicable which it is for CBC, are computed from the given password and a random salt value by a Password Based Key Derivation Function that makes it more difficult for an adversary to try password-guessing attacks. I don't know your JS module (or much JS at all) but the webpage you link lists a variety of low-level primitives suggesting it does not automatically do PBE. A text string like ""password"" is (possibly) suitable for PBE, but not direct AES encryption where the key must be exactly 128, 192 or 256 bits and should be random binary data. 
If you want openssl's semi-standard PBE, match it on the JS side; the item evpkey sounds possibly helpful, since EVP is the openssl module involved and I know no other (PB)KDF scheme that would be called EVP. If not, the enc default PBE is just MD5 of the password concatenated with the salt, iterated with feedback as many times as needed which in this case is three. See https://superuser.com/questions/455463/openssl-hash-function-for-generating-aes-key for an example in (mostly) perl. OpenSSL prefixes the 8 ASCII chars ""Salted__"" and the 8 bytes of salt to the file, so you need to remove those (and use the salt) before decrypt, or add them after encrypt.
If you want raw encryption, choose a more suitable key (on whichever side), and a unique and unpredictable IV unless you always use a new key in which case you can use a fixed IV, and on the openssl side use -K (note uppercase) and -iv to specify those values in hex. See the manpage on any Unix system with openssl installed or https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/enc.html .
Plus in either case enc defaults to ""PKCS#5"" (really PKCS#7) padding. I don't know if your JS module does; if not you should specify it. Unless you can guarantee your plaintexts will always be an exact multiple of 16 bytes (after any encoding like UTF8); then you could specify (or maybe default) no padding on the JS side and specify -nopad on the openssl side.

","This PHP code, which includes command line OpenSSL encryption:
http://pastebin.com/sivmZvSw
...is compatible with this CryptoJS code, which I normally run on the command line using jsc on my Mac:
http://pastebin.com/LcDBG7yj
(This code was written with CryptoJS 3.1.2, although I wouldn't expect a major difference between that and 3.1.5.)
The tricks are:

As indicated by the other answer, you need to specify the exact key and IV on both sides in order for it to work.
Even though AES-256 can theoretically handle 128-bit keys, I have found that only 256-bit keys seem to work.
In these examples I have avoided using a salt value. You could arguably make it more secure by including salt, but make sure you specify it correctly in both places.
The other thing that catches people out is they think they can just pass a string to the CryptoJS.decrypt() function. This is not correct. CryptoJS.decrypt() expects a cipherParams object. (See example.)
Regarding padding: both CryptoJS and OpenSSL default to PKCS#7, which is functionally equivalent to PKCS#5 except PKCS#7 can handle any block size. When we're talking about 8-byte block sizes, they are identical. Anyway, you shouldn't need to specify the padding in CrytoJS.

Good luck!

The reason I need this is I need to decrypt something CryptoJS.AES.encrypt returned using Lua, but I only have the key that was provided.
","CryptoJS' CryptoJS.<BlockCipher>.encrypt has two modes of encryption. 

If you pass in a key that is not a string, but rather a WordArray (CryptoJS's internal representation format for binary data), the key is taken as-is. This mode expects an IV for all modes of operation except ECB, which doesn't use an IV, so you don't have to specify one. If no IV is passed, it will default (through some JavaScript magic) to a zero filled IV (consisting of a full block of 0x00 bytes).
If you pass in a ""key"" that is a string, it will assume the ""key"" is a password. In order to derive a key from the password, it uses the OpenSSL-compatible derivation function EVP_BytesToKey. This mode generates a new 8 byte random salt and uses it along with the password to generate a key and IV. Even if you explicitly pass in an IV, it won't be used.
CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msg, password).toString()

results in a Base64-encoded ciphertext that contains the string ""Salted__"" at the beginning followed by the 8 byte salt and the actual ciphertext. You can explicitly split this before use with:
var ct = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msg, password);
var saltHex = ct.salt.toString();     // random salt
var ctHex = ct.ciphertext.toString(); // actual ciphertext
var ivHex = ct.iv.toString();         // generated IV

If you need to recreate the same key derivation. Have a look at the code and the specification.
Keys should have high entropy and be indistinguishable from random noise, which makes it hard for them to be brute-forced. The above mentioned EVP_BytesToKey is not secure, because MD5 hashing is very fast, which enables an attacker to brute-force the password. You either need to use a really long password (20-30 characters) or use an appropriate key derivation function such as PBKDF2, which CryptoJS provides.

","In browser string encoding usually is UTF-8, so use UTF-8 as string encoding should fix it. BTW, you should explicitly set string encoding in both side to make sure you will get same result.

The encrypt method is pretty straight forward. It takes the plainText and encrypts the data using the key and iv created above, then returns it in a URL friendly string. For example, 
""Email=testuser@gmail.com&ProductUserId=C4B80D7F-A8D0-11E4-BA34-AC7BA1ACF56B""

Any help that can be provided is greatly appreciated.
Thank you
","The reason this doesn't work is probably the key generation: You use ASCII zeros instead of \0 and you have 16 of them and not 8 (MD5 gives 16 bytes and you want a 24 byte TDES key). This isn't bad for the key as CryptoJS will just disregard the additional bytes, but since you reverse the key to get the IV, you get a wrong IV instead.

Android 2x SHA512
Android 1x SHA512 -> CryptoJS 1x SHA512
PHP 2x SHA512
So, when I do the first 2x Android hashing, I get the same result as when I do the 1x android -> 1x cryptojs.
However, when I do the PHP 2x, I get the same result as I get on the first Android pass, but the second encryption pass of the PHP is different.
On PHP, I've tried both the hash() and openssl_digest() functions with raw bytes as output.
PHP:
$firstpass = base64_encode(hash('sha512', $enteredPassword, true));
//$firstpass = base64_encode(hash('sha512', $enteredPassword, true));

//$secondpass = base64_encode(openssl_digest($firstpass, 'sha512', true));

"34110192","How to encode md5 sum to base64 in Javascript","I have a login web form, user writes his password and I must encrypt it on MD5 and the sum to base 64. I'm doing like this with CryptoJS:
var hash = CryptoJS.MD5(cred.password); // password is `password`
cred.password = hash.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64); // X03MO1qnZdYdgyfeuILPmQ==  --  IT IS OK!

This works fine. Then I must convert the following string to MD5 and Base64 too:
var digest = ""john.doe,""+hash.toString()+"",QCiTzbXCAYA3AvDgYN3MuBwY/1i89q6TfW7aVS1Av1c="";

again I do:
var hash1 = CryptoJS.MD5(digest);
digestResult = hash1.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

It returns i4a9M2b6l+yBZLHc3bXWMA== but the expected by the server for this conbination is 6R1HZqYJFfRQUA0L/hqCEA==
I guess Crypto is not working for a base64/md5 inside the string to convert?
I dont get why it returns bad
","The function CryptoJS.MD5(cred.password) returns a typedArray, not a string. It has a toString function which returns the common hexadecimal representation. All of that won't fit very well together. You'll need to probe the client/server strings to see what one sends and the other accepts but you should use the hexadecimal string representation all the way up to the final base64 encoding, mixing them is not very healthy.
EDIT after some comments given by the OP
var hash = CryptoJS.MD5(cred.password); // password is `password`
// ""hash"" contains a typed array, needs to be base64
hash = hash.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64); // X01jw2Jap2XWHYMn3riCz5k=
var digest = ""john.doe,""+hash+"",QCiTzbXCAYA3AvDgYN3MuBwY/1i89q6TfW7aVS1Av1c="";

In this particular scenario, I am encrypting data on the client side with Crypto-JS and decrypting it back on a python server with PyCrypto.
encrypt.js:
  var password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP';
  var data = 'mytext';

  var masterKey = CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();

  // Derive keys for AES and HMAC
  var length = masterKey.toString().length / 2
  var encryptionKey = masterKey.substr(0, length);
  var hmacKey = masterKey.substr(length);

  var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(64/8);

  var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
    data,
    encryptionKey,
    {
      iv: iv,
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFB
    }
  );

  var concat = iv + encrypted;

  // Calculate HMAC using iv and cipher text
  var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(concat, hmacKey);

  // Put it all together
  var registrationKey = iv + encrypted + hash;

  // Encode in Base64
  var basemessage = btoa(registrationKey);

decrypt.py:
class AESCipher:
    def __init__(self, key):
        key_hash = SHA256.new(key).hexdigest()
        # Derive keys
        encryption_key = key_hash[:len(key_hash)/2]
        self.key = encryption_key            
        self.hmac_key = key_hash[len(key_hash)/2:]


    def verify_hmac(self, input_cipher, hmac_key):
        # Calculate hash using inputted key
        new_hash = HMAC.new(hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
        new_hash.update(input_cipher)
        digest = new_hash.hexdigest()

        # Calculate hash using derived key from local password
        local_hash = HMAC.new(self.hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
        local_hash.update(input_cipher)
        local_digest = local_hash.hexdigest()

        return True if digest == local_digest else False


    def decrypt(self, enc):
        enc = base64.b64decode(enc)
        iv = enc[:16]
        hmac = enc[60:]
        cipher_text = enc[16:60]

        # Verify HMAC using concatenation of iv + cipher like in js
        verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), self.hmac_key)

password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP'

input = 'long base64 registrationKey...'

cipher = AESCipher(password)
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(input)

I'm successful in re-calculating the HMAC but when I try and then decrypt the cipher I get something that seems encrypted with �'s in the result.
I was getting errors about input length of cipher text but when I switched to CFB mode that fixed it so I don't think it's a padding issue.
","There are many problems with your code.
Client (JavaScript):

AES has a block size of 128 bit and CFB mode expects a full block for the IV. Use
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

The iv and hash variables are WordArray objects, but encrypted is not. When you force them to be converted to strings by concatenating them (+), iv and hash are Hex-encoded, but encrypted is formatted in an OpenSSL compatible format and Base64-encoded. You need to access the ciphertext property to get the encrypted WordArray:
var concat = iv + encrypted.ciphertext;

and
var registrationKey = iv + encrypted.ciphertext + hash;

registrationKey is hex-encoded. There is no need to encode it again with Base64 and bloat it even more:
var basemessage = registrationKey;

If you want to convert the hex encoded registrationKey to base64 encoding, use:
var basemessage = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(registrationKey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

concat is a hex-encoded string of the IV and ciphertext, because you forced the stringification by ""adding"" (+) iv and encrypted. The HmacSHA256() function takes either a WordArray object or a string. When you pass a string in, as you do, it will assume that the data is UTF-8 encoded and try to decode it as UTF-8. You need to parse the data yourself into a WordArray:
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(concat), hmacKey);

The CryptoJS.AES.encrypt() and CryptoJS.HmacSHA256() expect the key either as a WordArray object or as a string. As before, if the key is supplied as a string, a UTF-8 encoding is assumed which is not the case here. You better parse the strings into WordArrays yourself:
var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));


Server (Python):

You're not verifying anything in verify_hmac(). You hash the same data with the same key twice. What you need to do is hash the IV+ciphertext and compare the result with the hash (called tag or HMAC-tag) that you slice off the full ciphertext.
def verify_hmac(self, input_cipher, mac):
    # Calculate hash using derived key from local password
    local_hash = HMAC.new(self.hmac_key, digestmod=SHA256)
    local_hash.update(input_cipher)
    local_digest = local_hash.digest()

    return mac == local_digest

And later in decrypt():
verified_hmac = self.verify_hmac((iv+cipher_text), hmac)

You need to correctly slice off the MAC. The 60 that is hardcoded is a bad idea. Since you're using SHA-256 the MAC is 32 bytes long, so you do this
hmac = enc[-32:]
cipher_text = enc[16:-32]

The CFB mode is actually a set of similar modes. The actual mode is determined by the segment size. CryptoJS only supports segments of 128 bit. So you need tell pycrypto to use the same mode as in CryptoJS:
cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv, segment_size=128)

If you want to use CFB mode with a segment size of 8 bit (default of pycrypto), you can use a modified version of CFB in CryptoJS from my project: Extension for CryptoJS

var password = 'BJhtfRjKnTDTtPXUBnErKDxfkiMCOLyP';
var data = 'mytext';

var masterKey = CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();
var length = masterKey.length / 2
var encryptionKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(0, length));
var hmacKey = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(masterKey.substr(length));

var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
    data,
    encryptionKey,
    {
      iv: iv,
      mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFB
    }
);

var concat = iv + encrypted.ciphertext; 
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(concat), hmacKey);

"31230994","What's the best option using cryptojs, have the key stored in client and server sides, or generate the key and pass it some way to the other side?","I want to encrypt and decrypt the data passed between the client and the server using cryptojs. To decrypt the data it is necessary to know the key used, so Imhave two options:

Use a fixed key stored in both sides.
Generate randomly the key and pass it to the other side with the data.

In both cases, if the petition is captured, you can resend it to the server and access to the page.
If I use a fixed key, if you get the key, you can decrypt all the messages, except if you change the key.
If I pass the key with the data, you get the key with the data (I pass in a no clear way, so you have to know what part is the key and what part is the data). But this key changes with every petition.
Anyway, I think the attacker could just see the client side code and discover the procedure used to encrypt the data and do the opposite procedure.
What's the best option?
PD: I know that https is the way, but I want tp do this too.
","Option: 1
Assuming that you want to use CryptoJS and you want to use HTTP, and you don't want the attacker to know the secret key, you can use PBKDF2.

PBKDF2 is a password-based key derivation function

You can generate a key from the user's password on browser and use it to encrypt the data encryption key.  
On server side, assuming that you will have access to user's password from the user database, you can re-generate the same PBDKF2 key using the password and decrypt the data encryption key.
Once both server and client have agreed on a shared data encryption key, they can have future exchange of data using that key.  In this process, a hacker may not get access to the data encryption key as it was exchanged in encrypted form.  Also, it requires a human to enter a password whose value hacker is not aware of.
NOTE 1: This solution will not work if you are authenticating user against third party authentication provider and you do not have access to user's password.
NOTE 2: CryptoJS seems to support only symmetric ciphers - hence, there will be a need to exchange key between client and server.  The key has to be exchanged via a shared secret that is not shared using the same channel on which key will be used.
Option: 2
If you cant use PBDKF2 for some reason, and still want to exchange keys securely between client and server, then, you will have to employ asymmetric encryption.  A library JSEncrypt provides RSA encryption.
If this library is employed, then, client (browser) can generate a key usng CryptoJS and encrypt it with a RSA public key using JSEncrypt and send the encrypted key to server.  Server can decrypt the encrypted-key using RSA private key.  This process will result in safe exchange of key.

Here's the JS:
Crypto.AES.encrypt('1234567890123456', '1234567890123456',
                   {mode: new Crypto.mode.CBC(Crypto.pad.ZeroPadding)})
// output: ""wRbCMWcWbDTmgXKCjQ3Pd//aRasZ4mQr57DgTfIvRYE=""

The python:
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64
decryptor = AES.new('1234567890123456', AES.MODE_CBC)
decryptor.decrypt(base64.b64decode(""wRbCMWcWbDTmgXKCjQ3Pd//aRasZ4mQr57DgTfIvRYE=""))
# output: '\xd0\xc2\x1ew\xbb\xf1\xf2\x9a\xb9\xb6\xdc\x15l\xe7\xf3\xfa\xed\xe4\xf5j\x826\xde(m\xdf\xdc_\x9e\xd3\xb1'

","Here is a version with CryptoJS 3.1.2. Always beware of the following things (use the same in both languages):

Mode of operation (CBC in this case)
Padding (Zero Padding in this case; better use PKCS#7 padding)
Key (the same derivation function or clear key)
Encoding (same encoding for key, plaintext, ciphertext, ...)
IV (generated during encryption, passed for decryption)

If a string is passed as the key argument to the CryptoJS encrypt() function, the string is used to derive the actual key to be used for encryption. If you wish to use a key (valid sizes are 16, 24 and 32 byte), then you need to pass it as a WordArray.
The result of the CryptoJS encryption is an OpenSSL formatted ciphertext string. To get the actual ciphertext from it, you need to access the ciphertext property on it.
The IV must be random for each encryption so that it is semantically secure. That way attackers cannot say whether the same plaintext that was encrypted multiple times is actually the same plaintext when only looking at the ciphertext.
Below is an example that I have made.
JavaScript:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('1234567890123456');

function encrypt(msgString, key) {
    // msgString is expected to be Utf8 encoded
    var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msgString, key, {
        iv: iv
    });
    return iv.concat(encrypted.ciphertext).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
}

function decrypt(ciphertextStr, key) {
    var ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(ciphertextStr);

    // split IV and ciphertext
    var iv = ciphertext.clone();
    iv.sigBytes = 16;
    iv.clamp();
    ciphertext.words.splice(0, 4); // delete 4 words = 16 bytes
    ciphertext.sigBytes -= 16;

    // decryption
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({ciphertext: ciphertext}, key, {
        iv: iv
    });
    return decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}

Python code:
BLOCK_SIZE = 16
key = b""1234567890123456""

def pad(data):
    length = BLOCK_SIZE - (len(data) % BLOCK_SIZE)
    return data + chr(length)*length

def unpad(data):
    return data[:-ord(data[-1])]

def encrypt(message, passphrase):
    IV = Random.new().read(BLOCK_SIZE)
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    return base64.b64encode(IV + aes.encrypt(pad(message)))

def decrypt(encrypted, passphrase):
    encrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted)
    IV = encrypted[:BLOCK_SIZE]
    aes = AES.new(passphrase, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    return unpad(aes.decrypt(encrypted[BLOCK_SIZE:]))


Other considerations:
It seems that you want to use a passphrase as a key. Passphrases are usually human readable, but keys are not. You can derive a key from a passphrase with functions such as PBKDF2, bcrypt or scrypt.
The code above is not fully secure, because it lacks authentication. Unauthenticated ciphertexts may lead to viable attacks and unnoticed data manipulation. Usually the an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is employed with a good MAC function such as HMAC-SHA256.

"21847182","Decipher an AES enciphered binary file with Crypto.JS","What I'm trying to achieve
I'm working on a browser based quiz game with prerecorded audio clues which get sent to the user. To take load of the servers as well as having the audio already transmitted the files are already sent way earlier before the game starts to the user. As the game is to be played in real time and competetively, it is of importance that the player has no chance to listen to the audio files before. My idea now was to basically send AES enciphered files to the user, send only the password of the file in real time over websockets, decipher it in the browser using crypto.js and play it instantly.
The Problem
For some reason I can't get binary files decrypted properly using crypto.js so I can feed it into decodeAudioData of an audio context. I get empty responses from decrypt or gibberish back.
What I tried
The audio (in this case an mp3) is AES encrypted according to the docs using the following call:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in infile -out outfile -pass pass:""testpass"" -e -base64

The resulting file is then loaded via XMLHTTPRequest with request type text (I already tried arraybuffer but failed too) and the result is stored in a variable (this.protectedBuffer).
According to Crypto.js docs, this should now decrypt the file:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(this.protectedBuffer, 'testpass');
// next step obviously doesn't work as decrypted is
// is not an arraybuffer.
context.decodeAudioData(decrypted, function() { ... }); 

This however results in nothing playable and returns only a wordlist. I know I'm missing some step but I have absolutely no clue right now what is not working and would be more than glad if someone could point me in the right direction and tell me what I did wrong.
EDIT: Here is a jsfiddle with what I'm trying to achieve http://jsfiddle.net/HKu3n/1/
","When openssl generates a base64-encoded file, it inserts a lot of whitespace.  In particular, it breaks the output up into 64-byte lines:
U2FsdGVkX18AVcl/JumJawmKlaYWjQwo6wDcETza5AX6VK6aVCMtHXic2xtDIw1G
PJfxbKLJKWgvKXLNGO0jgPTI6qFPllts6VAIzvZ3uqV8BBPd0ge4YJe/q7e7ZGmx
QJyvFnyumo3b2pMxxMWngtl8qpxcsaiSrALnBXZizJ70PcTsyfk7aym1twkj0ofY
...

And at the end, a final newline.  The crypto-js encryption utilities do not like all of that whitespace, so you must remove it (which I do with a split/join).  For example:
$.get('/audio.aes', function(data){
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(data.split(/\s/).join(''), 'testpass');
    // ...
});

What CryptoJS.AES.decrypt returns is a WordArray object.  To convert it to a string, you must call toString and provide an encoding:
decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

I didn't have any audio files handy, but I was able to make this work end-to-end with an image (served up at /image.aes):
$.get('/image.aes', function(data){
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(data.split(/\s/).join(''), 'testpass');
    $('#imageContainer').append('<img src=""data:image/jpeg;base64,'
        + decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64) + '"">');
    });
});

And I saw an image on the other end!  You might have to get some wrangling to get the decoded data into the right format for your audio output, but I hope this will get you over the hump.
UPDATE
I got it working with your example jsFiddle, using your audio.  To get the ArrayBuffer necessary, I used base64DecToArr available here:
var decoded = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(request.response.split(/\s/).join(''),
    'testpass');

var arr = base64DecToArr(decoded.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64));
context.decodeAudioData(arr.buffer, function (buffer) {
    alert('success decoding buffer');
}, function (err) {
    alert('couldn\'t decode buffer');
});

Working jsFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/BTnpL/
There's probably a more efficient way to convert the WordArray object returned from the crypto-js functions to the ArrayBuffer used by decodeAudioData, but I'll leave that as an exercise for you.

","There is no such language that supports binary data strings in the code. You need to encode the binary data into some format such as Hex or Base64 and let CryptoJS decode it into it's own internal binary format which you then can pass to the various CryptoJS functions:
var wordArrayFromUtf = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""test"");
var wordArrayFromHex = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""74657374""); // ""test""
var wordArrayFromB64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""dGVzdA==""); // ""test""

Other functions are:
wordArrayFromHex.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)  // ""test""
CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(wordArrayFromB64) // ""test""

If you pass a string into a CrypoJS function (not these here), it will be assumed to be a Utf8-encoded string. If you don't want that, you need to decode it yourself.

I have tested aes cipher algorithm on a dummy string its working fine.
Now i want it to implement it on Uint8Array. This array is holding a video file data.
Since the encryption and decryption works on a string, i have to convert it to a string for that i have referenced this question posted on the stackoverflow click here
Code for encryption is :
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, uInt8Array), ""test"");

But when i ran the code following error is coming:
 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded 

How do i make it working?
","That error is due the String.fromCharCode.apply(null, uInt8Array) part, CryptoJS is never called.
Note that full syntax of fromCharCode is String.fromCharCode(n1, n2, ..., nX), so all elements of the given buffer must be moved to the stack in order to apply the function.
You must be using a very big buffer, a video file you said, so that must be the reason you got a stackoverflow error.
Try to use a `CryptoJS.lib.WordArray' instead, as described here:

"16680631","How do I encrypt Crypto-JS keys with JSBN?","I'm using JSBN to encrypt/decrypt data using public/private keypairs.  It works great for text data, including hex strings.
My problem is now I have binary data, specifically Crypto-JS Word Arrays, that I need to encrypt with a public key and send along to another platform.
So consider this:
var key = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(256/8);
var rsa = new RSAKey();
rsa.setPublic(modulus, exponent);
var encrypted_key = rsa.encrypt(key.toString());

This works but it means 'encrypted_key' is infact a hex string that's been encrypted, not the actual key.  I need to encrypt the actual key.
So I see two challenges here:
1) I'm not 100% sure how to get the actual bytes out of a CryptoJS.lib.WordArray -- though that doesn't seem totally insurmountable.
2) I have no idea if it's even possible to encrypt binary data using JSBN.  I'd love pointers to figure out how to do it.
Any thoughts?
","The JSBN library contains a function, namely pkcs1pad2(), wherein it converts the text to numeric values using JavaScript's charCodeAt() function.  You'll see that conversion code in the first while() loop:
function pkcs1pad2(s,n) {
  if(n < s.length + 11) { // TODO: fix for utf-8
    alert(""Message too long for RSA"");
    return null;
  }
  var ba = new Array();
  var i = s.length - 1;
  while(i >= 0 && n > 0) {
    var c = s.charCodeAt(i--);
    if(c < 128) { // encode using utf-8
      ba[--n] = c;
    }
    else if((c > 127) && (c < 2048)) {
      ba[--n] = (c & 63) | 128;
      ba[--n] = (c >> 6) | 192;
    }
    else {
      ba[--n] = (c & 63) | 128;
      ba[--n] = ((c >> 6) & 63) | 128;
      ba[--n] = (c >> 12) | 224;
    }
  }
  ba[--n] = 0;
  var rng = new SecureRandom();
  var x = new Array();
  while(n > 2) { // random non-zero pad
    x[0] = 0;
    while(x[0] == 0) rng.nextBytes(x);
    ba[--n] = x[0];
  }
  ba[--n] = 2;
  ba[--n] = 0;
  return new BigInteger(ba);
}

If you wish to encrypt binary data then you'll likely have to modify this function so it converts the input in the way you want it. 
Below is an example of pkcs1pad2() modified to accept binary data in the form of a hex string. If you use this version of pkcs1pad2() then you can convert your CryptoJS.lib.WordArray into hex and pass that hex string to rsa.encrypt().
function pkcs1pad2(hexPlaintext,n) {
  if(n < hexPlaintext.length/2 + 11) {
    alert(""Message too long for RSA"");
    return null;
  }
  var ba = new Array();
  var i = hexPlaintext.length;
  while(i >= 2 && n > 0) {
    ba[--n] = parseInt(hexPlaintext.slice(i-2,i),16);
    i-=2;
  }
  ba[--n] = 0;
  var rng = new SecureRandom();
  var x = new Array();
  while(n > 2) { // random non-zero pad
    x[0] = 0;
    while(x[0] == 0) rng.nextBytes(x);
    ba[--n] = x[0];
  }
  ba[--n] = 2;
  ba[--n] = 0;
  return new BigInteger(ba);
}

Alternatively, you could modify it to take the WordArray directly and convert that to the array format that is used by JSBN, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

","What are you doing with the encrypted chunks? If you're, say, uploading them over the network, you don't need to store them in an array first.  Instead, you can upload the encrypted file chunk by chunk, either writing your own chunked upload implementation (it's not terribly hard) or by using an existing library.
Ditto for the input: you can encrypt it as you read it.  You can use the JS File API to read the file in chunks, using the .slice() method.
Other than that, your code looks just like the recommended way to progressively encrypt a file.

"33914764","How to read a binary file with FileReader in order to hash it with SHA-256 in CryptoJS?","how do I convert a UTF-8 string to Latin1 encoded string using javascript?
Here is what I am trying to do:

I get a file, split that in chunks by reading as arraybuffer 
then, I parse the arraybuffer as string
and passing it to cryptoJS for hash computation using following code:
cryptosha256 = CryptoJS.algo.SHA256.create();
cryptosha256.update(text);
hash = cryptosha256.finalize();


It all works well for a text file. I get problems when using the code for hashing a non-text files (image/.wmv files). I saw in another blog and there the CryptoJS author requires the bytes to be sent using Latin1 format instead of UTF-8 and that's where I am stuck.
Not sure, how can I generate the bytes (or strings) using Latin1 format from arraybuffer in javascript?
$('#btnHash').click(function () {
    var fr = new FileReader(), 
        file = document.getElementById(""fileName"").files[0];
    fr.onload = function (e) {
        calcHash(e.target.result, file);
    };
    fr.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
});
function calcHash(dataArray, file) {
    cryptosha256 = CryptoJS.algo.SHA256.create();
    text = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(dataArray);
    cryptosha256.update(text);
    hash = cryptosha256.finalize();
}

","CryptoJS doesn't understand what an ArrayBuffer is and if you use some text encoding like Latin1 or UTF-8, you will inevitably lose some bytes. Not every possible byte value has a valid encoding in one of those text encodings.
You will have to convert the ArrayBuffer to CryptoJS' internal WordArray which holds the bytes as an array of words (32 bit integers). We can view the ArrayBuffer as an array of unsigned 8 bit integers and put them together to build the WordArray (see arrayBufferToWordArray).
The following code shows a full example:


function arrayBufferToWordArray(ab) {
  var i8a = new Uint8Array(ab);
  var a = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < i8a.length; i += 4) {
    a.push(i8a[i] << 24 | i8a[i + 1] << 16 | i8a[i + 2] << 8 | i8a[i + 3]);
  }
  return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(a, i8a.length);
}

function handleFileSelect(evt) {
  var files = evt.target.files; // FileList object

  // Loop through the FileList and render image files as thumbnails.
  for (var i = 0, f; f = files[i]; i++) {
    var reader = new FileReader();

    // Closure to capture the file information.
    reader.onloadend = (function(theFile) {
      return function(e) {
        var arrayBuffer = e.target.result;

        var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(arrayBufferToWordArray(arrayBuffer));
        var elem = document.getElementById(""hashValue"");
        elem.value = hash;
      };

    })(f);
    reader.onerror = function(e) {
      console.error(e);
    };

    // Read in the image file as a data URL.
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(f);
  }
}

document.getElementById('upload').addEventListener('change', handleFileSelect, false);

You can extend this code with the techniques in my other answer in order to hash files of arbitrary size without freezing the browser.

","The documentation of CryptoJS says that when passing a plain passphrase (i.e. a String) to encrypt () , it will automatically generate a 256 bit key (Java implements the 128 bit version) using that password as the seed.
To prevent that you can use this function to directly convert your passphrase to a key:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""password"");

Possibly you will also have to synchronize the encodings of the ciphertexts. See here for a detailed example on how to perform interoperable encryption  with Java and CryptoJS.

Successfully encrypted a simple string (""SFTPPass"") with a key of (""Key"") in .NET, but once I get to decrypting in javascript not sure how to do it. 
This is what I have in javascript:
var encryptedPass = 'StrmZO1Vjd8noHYzXs8hiQQBQDJZA5Bpg3t4BcmrViU=';

var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse('1Ph1oX+N+q/kzpdyaIKBpA==');
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse('k/W+Xeenh3kSLneZ/DYXVpvshGbsFVdyfOFdFTJb1yE=');

var SFTPPass = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedPass, 'Key', key, {iv: iv});

However when I write my output to a file it's empty.
Any suggestions or alternative solutions are greatly welcomed!
EDIT:
With the recommendation by alancnet, I'm now getting output but the string doesn't match the original which is ""1234"". So I followed the guide in the link above down to the wire using the same Key Phrase and input string. Captured the hex of both the key & iv using BitConverter.toString in .NET.
key = ""752DA9F0D612540EEF1DE07A144781261A3D604DE339174ADAC5D5D6A695ABFF""
iv = ""9714413594225F1D14FA02101C0D584D""

What my javascript looks like now: 
var encryptedPass = 'Ao5ZnFYo344iWqv/Jr9euw==';

var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('9714413594225F1D14FA02101C0D584D');

var decryptedString = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedPass, key, {iv: iv});

","Your code:
var SFTPPass = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedPass, 'Key', key, {iv: iv});

'Key' is an unexpected parameter, and should be removed.
I ported your code to Node:
var CryptoJS = new require(""cryptojs"").Crypto;

var encryptedPass = 'StrmZO1Vjd8noHYzXs8hiQQBQDJZA5Bpg3t4BcmrViU=';

var iv = CryptoJS.util.base64ToBytes('1Ph1oX+N+q/kzpdyaIKBpA==');
var key = CryptoJS.util.base64ToBytes('k/W+Xeenh3kSLneZ/DYXVpvshGbsFVdyfOFdFTJb1yE=');

var SFTPPass = CryptoJS.util.bytesToBase64(
        CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(
            encryptedPass, 
            key, 
            {
                iv: iv, 
                asBytes: true
            }

","I figured it out, it was the format of how I was outputting the decrypted string. 
Played around with multiple versions...
 FileWrite(decryptedString);
 FileWrite(decryptedString.toString());

Ultimately what got it working was:
 FileWrite(decryptedString.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

Mind you the lower case of ""t"" and ""f"", tried doing ""UTF8"" and it gave me completely different output as well. 
Thanks again to alancnet for pointing out the main mistake I was doing in trying to use an invalid parameter, i probably wouldn't have noticed that till later in the day.

For the Javascript solution I am using CryptoJS
var AESKey = ""20190225165436_15230006321670000""
cc = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt( (""abcdef ha ha ""), AESKey, { mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7 } ).toString()
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cc, AESKey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);  //return abcdef ha ha 

Both solutions work well within their own environment, however the flutter or Javascript hashes can't be exchanged, they will not decrypt. My guess is that the character encoding has something to do with it, hence why the base64 sizes differ so much. Does anyone have a idea to get this working together? Thanks!
Does anyone have a idea to get this working together? Thanks!
","The main problem is that the two key derivation algorithms are different.
In your Dart/PC code you are using PBKDF2, but the KDF used by CryptoJS.AES.encrypt is OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey
You could implement the equivalent of EVP_BytesToKey in Dart using PC. However it would probably be easier to change the JavaScript code to derive its key using PBKDF2, which is already supported by CryptoJS. That will give you a key and IV to be used like this:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", key, { iv: iv });

","Your ""password"" (it is used as a key instead of a password) has two different encodings on client-side and server-side. On the client, you're parsing it as Hex, but on the server, you're passing it as a binary string, which is used as-is.
You either need parse it on the server (now it is AES-128 and not AES-256):
pass: new Buffer(""0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"", ""hex""),

Or change the encoding on the client (from AES-128 to AES-256):
pass: CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef""),

  encript: function (msg) {

You still have security problems:

The IV has to be randomly chosen for every encryption under the same key to achieve semantic security. It doesn't have to be secret, so you can simply send it along with the ciphertext. It's common to prepend it to the ciphertext and slice it off before decryption.
It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme with a strong MAC like HMAC-SHA256, which CryptoJS provides.

The idea is to decode sync data without sending sync key to the server. This is just context, the problem I have is much more specific.
One portion of code requires using sha256 to obtain certain key. I would like to replicate it in javascript. The approach I've tried, with CryptoJS, is this:
PHP code:
$key = hash_hmac(""sha256"",'OLA K ASE','CLAVE', false);
print $key;

Equivalent Javascript code (previously, I've included http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/hmac-sha256.js):
var hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(""OLA K ASE"", ""CLAVE"");
console.log(hash.toString());

This works fine. In each case, output is 9591d44df0c8e2d7a1f400f41117c536e10f58d7e28bdc1cad9d81e70290bc1b, which I suppose is correct. 
But, when I'm trying to encode non-ascii strings, results differ. For example, with this PHP code:
function hexstring($str){
    return preg_replace('/\\\\x([0-9a-f]{2})/e', 'chr(hexdec(\'$1\'))', $str);
}
$text = hexstring('\x00\x44\xb0\x2c\x0b');
$key = hexstring('\xd6\xf8\xb0\x2c\x0b');

I get 0697f5528c996006ffeb09b9130bf8e9056563245656d405e233bcafdbffb645. But with the 'equivalent' javascript code:

var key = ""\xd6\xf8\xb0\x2c\x0b"";
hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(text,key);

I thought it could be caused by non-ascii character, so I did a quick test:
$text = '';
for($i = 0;$i < 10; $i++){
    $text .= chr($i);
}
$key = '';
for($i = 0;$i < 10; $i++){
    $key .= chr($i*2);
}
$hash = hash_hmac(""sha256"",$text,$key, false);
print $hash;

And, javascript equivalent:

","Solved. It was a problem with character codes. Instead of this:

var key = ""\xd6\xf8\xb0\x2c\x0b"";
hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(text,key);

I should indicate CryptoJS that they were Latin-1 encoded strings:

var key = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(""\xd6\xf8\xb0\x2c\x0b"");

","There are probably a few issues we'll need to work through.
First, you need to make sure you're supplying the correct type of arguments to encrypt(). It looks like you may have realized in a comment that you need to do CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(symetricKeyHex), though your original post doesn't reflect this yet.
Second, you need to decide how you're getting or creating the IV on both ends. CryptoJS can create one if you use a passphrase, but you're trying to use an actual key rather than a passphrase. That means you'll have to set the IV like you set the key.
Finally, you'll have to decide how you're going to transmit both the IV and the ciphertext. A typical and simple solution is to prepend the IV to the ciphertext, but really anything that's easily serializable/unserializable will work fine. Just make sure that whatever format you decide on is consistent on both ends.

baseReader := base64.NewDecoder(base64.StdEncoding, strings.NewReader(enc))
encData, err := ioutil.ReadAll(baseReader)
//if err != nil { ....}, doesn't happen here
cipher, err := aes.NewCipher(symKey)
//if err != nil { ....}, doesn't happen here
byteData := make([]byte, len(encData))
cipher.Decrypt(byteData, encData)
fmt.Println(""Dec: "", string(byteData))
//Outputs unrepresentable characters

Any idea?

"45082597","PHP openssl_encrypt in JavaScript with CryptoJS","I have a problem generating the same ciphertext in JavaScript as provided in a  third party PHP server. The server side uses a simple one-liner to generate a key, but I can't find a way to do the same in my JavaScript client. 
I decided to use the CryptoJS library, from other SO answers , and I did generate a ciphertext but it was different that the one from a PHP server.
PHP encryption:
echo openssl_encrypt(""5905"",""AES-256-CBC"",""FbcCY2yCFBwVCUE9R+6kJ4fAL4BJxxjdRcqy5rHVLwU="",NULL,""e16ce913a20dadb8"");
// phgygAJB3GA0sa4D9k/d8A==

I have tried several solutions from Stack Overflow which failed to create the same ciphertext.
Also, the parameter ""AES-256-CBC"" in the PHP one-liner bothers me: I know what AES is, but I have no idea what those 256 or CBC parts are, and I don't know where to set those on the CryptoJS side.
My current attempt:
var key = 'FbcCY2yCFBwVCUE9R+6kJ4fAL4BJxxjdRcqy5rHVLwU=';
var iv = 'e16ce913a20dadb8';
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""5905"", CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key), { iv: CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(iv) });
var r1 = encrypted.ciphertext.toString(); // def44f8822cfb3f317a3c5b67182b437
var r2 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(encrypted.ciphertext) // 3vRPiCLPs/MXo8W2cYK0Nw==

My guess is that I am missing ""256"" and ""CBC"" parameters somewhere in JavaScript.
","Your ""key"" is 44 characters long which also equates to 44 bytes in PHP. This is not a valid key size. AES only supports 16, 24 and 32 byte keys. Anyway, this ""key"" will be truncated to 32 byte. So your actual key in PHP is:
""FbcCY2yCFBwVCUE9R+6kJ4fAL4BJxxjd""

Your IV is 16 characters (and byte) long, so it has the correct length and used as-is.
This is also why you can treat the key and IV in CryptoJS as strings:
CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""5905"", CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(key), { iv: CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(iv) });

But the correct way would be to decode the key from Base64 and generate a proper IV which is twice as long when encoded to Hex. It should be decoded from Hex before use.
The IV must be unpredictable (read: random). Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. The IV is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption.

","This is an old question but i just ran into same issue. The problem is that the CryptoJS.AES.encrypt method returns an object not a string. 
All you need to do is modify your encrypt function as follows:
function encrypt(data, key) {
   return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, key).toString();
}

Likewise, the decrypt function also returns an object so to get the string use:
function decrypt(data, key) {
   return CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(data, key).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}

","The reason this happens is that reader.readAsDataURL() is asynchronous. You have to pass a callback to readBlob which is called when it is finished:
function readBlob(opt_startByte, opt_stopByte, done) {
    ...
    reader.onload = function(evt) {           
        window.bits.push(CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(evt.target.result, window.password));

        })(startByte, endByte, callback);

","It seems that you need to do that the ""sync way"". You can find the documentation here -> http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#FileReaderSync.
I have also discovered this library - FileReader.js (http://bgrins.github.io/filereader.js/) that not only makes your life much easier when it comes to use FileReader, but also has already built in options to use the sync methods to synchronously read the files.

It seems that every file from the package CryptoJS use it something like:
var C_lib = C.lib;
var WordArray = C_lib.WordArray;
var BlockCipher = C_lib.BlockCipher;

So, most probably you have to link core.js if you are using development version.

Because my salt and iv are string, I parse them with Utf8:
CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(salt);
CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(iv);

And for key generation, I use static values:
        var key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(

        CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(salt),
        { keySize: 512/32, iterations: 1000 }

","Check the contents of AES.encrypt(secret, key) - it is an object with a number of fields, iv and salt of particular interest (jsFiddle).
Each time you run the AES.encrypt crypto-js chooses new IV and new salt (you can supply your own values, by the way). Random IV means that output will be different even with the same key, and random salt means that the actual encryption key is different too, because it is derived from the the passphrase and salt. 
You may (actually, should) ask why the first ten Base64 output characters are the same when both the encryption key and IV are different? That is because calling toString() on the ecnryption result converts it into ""OpenSSL-compatible string"", which is basically Base64(""Salted__"" + salt + ciphertext), where ""Salted__"" is the constant prefix which, of course, leads the same prefix in the Base64 output.

"39610952","Java method to decrypt an AES string from Angular-Cryptography","I'm trying to do a login method that keeps the client password secure and encrypted in my server.
The library I'm using from Angular, is https://github.com/middleout/angular-cryptography
The idea is, to follow these steps:

I set a salt in my module.config: 
app.config(['$cryptoProvider', function($cryptoProvider){
    $cryptoProvider.setCryptographyKey('thisismysalt');
}]);

I encrypt the password with itself:
user.pw = $crypto.encrypt(user.pw, user.pw);

If I'm registering an user, I re-encrypt the password with itself (repeat step 2) and save it in the DB. If I'm logging, I just send the result from the last step, to the server.
When you decypher the double-encrypted string with the single-encrypted one, you get the single encrypted string again. So if your password was correct, you just compare the result with the single-encrypted string, and you validate the user.


Ok, this method should work (I already did it in Node some time ago), works great with SSL to protect user's passwords even in your server!
But I can't find any library or snippet in Java that can do it. I tried many of them, but they are hard to understand and when I adapt them to my procedure, they just won't work. I tried the following method:
static String IV = ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"";
static String plaintext = ""test text 123\0\0\0""; /*Note null padding*/
static String encryptionKey = ""0123456789abcdef"";

public static String decrypt(byte[] cipherText, String encryptionKey) throws Exception{
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/NoPadding"", ""SunJCE"");
    SecretKeySpec key = new SecretKeySpec(encryptionKey.getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""AES"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key,new IvParameterSpec(IV.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));
    return new String(cipher.doFinal(cipherText),""UTF-8"");
}

I passed it as first argument, the double-encrypted password from the DB, and as second argument, the single-encrypted password from the frontend:

java.security.InvalidKeyException: Invalid AES key length: 44 bytes

Am I doing something wrong? Should I use a different algorithm? 
","middleout/angular-cryptography uses CryptoJS 3.1.2 under the hood with the least effort possible.
So 
return $crypto.encrypt(plaintext, password);

is the same as
$cryptoProvider.setCryptographyKey(password); 
return $crypto.encrypt(plaintext, password);

and the same as 
return CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, password).toString();

I describe in my answer here how to do the same thing in Java.

If you're using SSL/TLS, there is not much benefit to doing this encryption additionally. The password is already sent in an encrypted way over the internet. Even worse, since the password must be available at the server side, you must store the password in cleartext. That's not how it is done.
You need to use hashing instead with some strong ones being PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt and Argon2. Since hash functions are one-way function, you won't be able to ""decrypt"" the hashes. In order to authenticate your user, you can run the password through the hash function again in order to compare with the hash that is stored in the database. Since you're already using SSL/TLS, the password is already secured during transmission. See more: How to securely hash passwords?

"29424027","Using the nonce and counter correctly for AES-CTR mode","I understand that in AES Counter mode I need to use a 128 bit nonce. The naïve way to do that would be to use a random 128 bit nonce, but I'm not sure the algorithm will be able to increment the counter correctly if it's passed as all random bits. I thought the correct way to do it is to use a 96 bit nonce and also a 32 bit counter starting at 0, for example:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('01ab23cd45ef67089a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b'); // 128 bits / 16 bytes
var nonce = '2301cd4ef785690a1b2c3dab'; // 96 bits / 12 bytes
var counter = '00000000'; // 32 bits / 4 bytes
var nonceAndCounter = nonce + counter;
    nonceAndCounter = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(nonceAndCounter);
var plaintext = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

var encryption = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, key, { iv: nonceAndCounter, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CTR, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding });
var ciphertext = encryption.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);

Is this the correct way to do it with the CryptoJS library? Or what is the correct way?
","I'm going to answer my own question as I went digging into the library code to see what it really does.
Summary:
The answer is you can use either of two methods and it will work as expected:
1) Pass in a random nonce of 96 bits in length and the library itself will add the 32 bit counter automatically and increment it with every keystream block generated. E.g. 
var nonce = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('2301cd4ef785690a1b2c3dab'); // 12 Bytes
var encryption = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, key, { iv: nonce, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CTR, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding });

2) Pass in a random nonce of 96 bits in length and explicitly specify the 32 bit counter as well if you want to. You can even specify a counter like 00000009 if you want to start encrypting/decrypting from the 9th block. Below is an example starting from counter 0:
var nonce = '2301cd4ef785690a1b2c3dab';  // 12 Bytes
var counter = '00000000';                // 4 Bytes, start at counter 0
var nonceAndCounter = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(nonce + counter);  // 16 Bytes
var encryption = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, key, { iv: nonceAndCounter, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CTR, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding });

Explanation:
Using the code in the question with 32 bit counter of 00000000, the relevant code is in this file mode-ctr.js:
/**
 * Counter block mode.
 */
CryptoJS.mode.CTR = (function () {
    var CTR = CryptoJS.lib.BlockCipherMode.extend();

    var Encryptor = CTR.Encryptor = CTR.extend({
        processBlock: function (words, offset) {
            // Shortcuts
            var cipher = this._cipher
            var blockSize = cipher.blockSize;
            var iv = this._iv;
            var counter = this._counter;

            // Generate keystream
            if (iv) {
                counter = this._counter = iv.slice(0);

                // Remove IV for subsequent blocks
                this._iv = undefined;
            }
            var keystream = counter.slice(0);
            cipher.encryptBlock(keystream, 0);

            // Increment counter
            counter[blockSize - 1] = (counter[blockSize - 1] + 1) | 0

            // Encrypt
            for (var i = 0; i < blockSize; i++) {
                words[offset + i] ^= keystream[i];
            }
        }
    });

    CTR.Decryptor = Encryptor;

    return CTR;
}());

When running this code in a browser JS debugger using a breakpoint, it converts the nonceAndCounter into a WordArray consisting of 32 bit elements:
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 0]
This is used to encrypt a block. To encrypt the next block it runs this line: 
counter[blockSize - 1] = (counter[blockSize - 1] + 1) | 0
Which evaluates to take the counter[3] element i.e. the integer 0 and increments it to:
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 1]
With subsequent blocks and nonces I can see...
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 2]
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 3]
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 4]
And so on. So it appears to be working correctly this way.
Contrast this with how it works if you pass a 128 bit random nonce e.g.
var nonceAndCounter = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('2301cd4ef785690a1b2c3dabdf99a9b3');
This produces a nonce of:
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, -543577677, 0]
So it creates 5 array elements!? Then the function increments the fourth element from -543577677 to -543577676, then -543577675, then -543577674 and so on. So it still works in a way, but but does not increment as nicely as starting from 0 and is perhaps more error prone.
When I passed in just a 96 bit random nonce, the library automatically added the start counter as 0 to the end of the counter array and incremented it correctly for subsequent blocks. e.g.
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 0]
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 1]
[587320654, -142251766, 455884203, 2]

","encrypted2.toString() will get you the OpenSSL formatted representation of the ciphertext. Note that it can't produce the same result, because you're using the password based encryption, during which a random salt is generated to produce the actual key and IV for the encryption. Every ciphertext that you produce with the same parameters will look differently.
Only the decryption of a ciphertext can get you the information whether the key+IV or password+salt were correct and then only when you have some kind of integrity check included (Padding is a poor-mans integrity check). See also: Should we MAC-then-encrypt or encrypt-then-MAC?
If you only want to check whether a username is the same, you should use the same techniques as used for passwords. That is, you should use hashing. CryptoJS provides multiple hash functions including an implementation of PBKDF2 for extra security. This will give you the property that you want when you set the password as the salt for PBKDF2.

You will need to modify parts of it because I changed some parameters around and don't reference your ""app"" object.
For what I did to fix it (from what I can recall).

The parameters have to be alphabetical. I placed them in an array and then sort them. I follow this up by a join with the ampersand.
I modified the sha256 function to return the base64 of the RAW sha256. Before it was returning the hexbits in lowercase, which isn't correct.
I was going to add a base64 before encoding, but the sha256 now handles all of the signing.
The date format was incorrect. It was returning a epoch timestamp instead of a string timestamp. I hacked together a simple timestamp option.
This code requires you to include the Base64 Library for CryptoJS also.

Can anyone help me or give me brief knowledge why this happens.
","There are multiple differences in the two codes:

You're probably using different modes of operation. Java is using ECB and JS is using CBC.  
Always use a fully qualified Cipher string. 
Cipher.getInstance(""TripleDES""); may result in different ciphers depending on the default security provider. It most likely results in ""TripleDES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"", but it doesn't have to be. If it changes, you'll lose compatibility between different JVMs. For reference: Java default Crypto/AES behavior
Also, PKCS#5 padding and PKCS#7 padding are equal for all intents and purposes.
Your key is likely different. A SHA-1 hash has an output of 20 bytes, but a full 3DES key is 24 bytes long. The Arrays.copyOf(digestOfPassword, 24); fills the remaining 4 bytes with 0x00 byte values. In CryptoJS, you're directly passing the short key into the encrypt function. You'd need to fill the remaining bytes with 0x00 bytes. Since CryptoJS handles binary data in a WordArray, this can be done in this way:
key = CryptoJS.SHA1(key);
key.sigBytes += 4; // 32 bit more marked
key.words.push(0); // 32 bit of zeros

Your IV is strange. It could be so easy:
var ivHex = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('0000000000000000'); // 8 bytes

This can be done for testing, but in production the IV must be unpredictable (read: random). Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. The IV is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption.

I would suggest that you throw away this code (only provides 80 bit of security and uses bad defaults) and use a library for that such as RNCryptor.

Security considerations
Never use ECB mode. It's deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. You should at the very least use a randomized mode like CBC or CTR. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.
Don't use Triple DES nowadays. It only provides at best 112 bit of security even if you use the largest key size of 192 bit. If a shorter key size is used, then it only provides 56 or 57 bits of security. AES would be faster (processors have a special AES-NI instruction set) and even more secure with the lowest key size of 128 bit. There is also a practical limit on the maximum ciphertext size with 3DES. See Security comparison of 3DES and AES.

NOTE: 
Ignore the security issues...like having the key exposed in js, etc. I'll be handling those later..
","You shouldn't be able to use AES CBC without padding unless the password is always 16 bytes. It probably applies some sort of default padding that may or may not be a good idea.
Anyway: you need to pass your key and iv to CryptoJS as a WordArray; if you give it a string it will assume you're giving it a passphrase and derive a different key from that. As such, your Java decryption code will be using a different key/iv pair. You can create a WordArray from your strings using 
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""abcdefghijklmnio"")
var iv = ...

"36196425","Converting C# Cryptography.Rijndael encryption to Javascript (pref. crypto-js)","I have two system which are sharing a user database, so authentication needs to be the same.
The passwords are currently encrypted using C#'s Cryptography.Rijndael(N.B. not RijndaelManaged). Using a custom key and iv (initialisation vector). (CBC mode and Pkcs7 padding)
The C# encryption is as follows:
Rijndael alg = Rijndael.Create();
alg.Key = key;
alg.IV = IV;
CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, alg.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write);
cs.Write(clearData, 0, clearData.Length);
cs.Close();
byte[] encryptedData = ms.ToArray();

key is 256 bits (32 bytes) and iv (initialisation vector) is 128 bits (16 bytes). The block size is 128 bits (16 bytes).
key and iv are a byte arrays from a base64 strings via: 
byte[] key = Convert.FromBase64String(base64Key);
byte[] iv = Convert.FromBase64String(base64IV);

N.B. I have no control on the C# code (legacy system).
On the javascript based system I have to encrypt the passwords exactly the same way. I've tried using node crypto-js to no avail.
my code looks something like this:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(password), keyCodeWords, {
    iv: ivCodeWords,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
});

keyCodeWords and ivCodeWords are CryptoJS code words from the same base64 key and iv as follows:
var keyCodeWords = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64Key);
var ivCodeWords = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64IV);

The encryption does work (in the sense that I can encrypt and then decrypt to get the same value). However, the issue is that the encrypted value (encrypted.ciphertext) is not the same as the C# one, so I'm unable to authenticate.
The comparison is done base comparing the base64 encrypted output strings.
How do I make crypto-js (or any other javascript encryption library) consistent with C# Rijndael?
","The code works correctly... Your problem is probably in the handling of the password/IV in C# or in Javascript... In C#: https://ideone.com/APC4MM and in Javascript: https://jsfiddle.net/jjwy5472/
I've used in both cases the same password:
byte[] key = new byte[]

    0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16, 0x17,
    0x18, 0x19, 0x1A, 0x1B, 0x1C, 0x1D, 0x1E, 0x1F,

byte[] iv = new byte[] 
{ 
    0x20, 0x21, 0x22, 0x23, 0x24, 0x25, 0x26, 0x27,
    0x28, 0x29, 0x2A, 0x2B, 0x2C, 0x2D, 0x2E, 0x2F,
};

the plaintext is
""Hello world! This is a wonderful day! àèéìòù""

and in both cases the resulting encrypted text is

But note that the encrypted variable in Javascript is a complex object, containing various properties with various versions of your encrypted data. encrypted.toString() returns the base64 version of the encrypted data, encrypted.ciphertext is a WordArray (the equivalent of CryptoJS of byte[]), and encrypted.ciphertext.toString() is the hex version of it (equivalent to doing BitConverter.ToString(encryptedData).Replace(""-"", """").ToLowerInvariant() in C#).

","There are a few things wrong with the code:

you are using hexadecimal decoding of the key in JavaScript, and String.getBytes() - character encoding without specifying the character set - in Java
your key is 16 characters (it should be 16, 24 or 32 randomized bytes), but it is not in hexadecimals
you are encrypting instead of decrypting on the ""server side"", although that one is probably on purpose

Take another good look on how to perform encoding and character-encoding, they are essential for good crypto and often performed incorrectly (it's probably the most common issue on Stackoverflow regarding encryption)

thanks to Artjom.B's answer(and chat :) ) we got it working, using his answer's client side code and fixing the server side code to be:

and now everything is working.
","In CryptoJS, if key is a string, then it will assume that key is actually a password, generate a random salt and derive the actual key and IV from password+salt (this is done in an OpenSSL-compatible way through EVP_BytesToKey).
CodeIgniter's Encryption library doesn't support this type of key derivation. You will either have to change your CryptoJS code to pass in a parsed WordArray:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""<? echo(bin2hex($key));?>"");
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
var encUser = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(user, key, {
    iv: iv
}).ciphertext;
return iv.concat(encUser).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

Since the IV is written in front of the ciphertext, CodeIgniter should read it correctly and it doesn't have to be specified explicitly. Make sure that key is correctly encoded as Hex or Base64, because binary encoding doesn't work in JavaScript correctly. Also, at the PHP side, the ciphertext must be decoded from Base64.
You could also implement EVP_BytesToKey in PHP as I've shown here.

var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, ""Secret Passphrase"");

Assuming the encryption and decryption phases are separated (happening in separate parts of the program), is there any way I can check if ""Secret Passphrase"" is the correct one in the decryption phase?
I've noticed that decrypting with a wrong passphrase will result in decrypted.toString() being an empty string. What then if the original message was an empty string too? Isn't there any other parameter I can use to check if the passphrase is indeed correct?

Side notes
My current solution: always create a non-empty control value, encrypted with the passphrase. If the control values decrypts to """", passphrase was not correct.
EDIT: turns out my solution doesn't work. Very similar passphrases are decrypting the message to different values which are, still, different from an empty string. The security is not compromised, but I still don't have any way to see if the passphrase was correct.
this is my very cool key! and this is my very cool key!! are both returning a string, even though only the first one is the actual passphrase used to encrypt.
EDIT 2: the string returned from the wrong passphrase is not valid UTF-8. Hence, calling value.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8) returns an error. I could use this error to check if the passphrase was correct. Still, this solutions sucks very much!
","You have just stumbled onto the subtle but important difference between message confidentiality and message integrity/authentication.
Confidentiality is what you are currently doing it ensures that the message can't be read in transit without the associated key but it can't ensure that the message hasn't been altered during transit (attacks on early crypto systems involved modifying the encrypted message to inject or reveal information about the crypto system). Your problem is a variant of this in that if you happened to find a key that decrypted the message ""surrender"" to ""bombs away"" then there is no way to know that they key was switched.
Integrity deals with ensuring that what is decrypted is what was actually encrypted in the first place and can also ensure Authentication (who encrypted it) depending on the model used. Integrity is best achieved by using a mode of operation the supports it intrinsically such as GCM but from a cursory glance crypto-js doesn't support any integrity modes.
This leaves you with a manual approach which requires producing and sending a HMAC along with the encrypted message.
var message = ""Message"";
var passphrase = ""Secret Passphrase"";
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, passphrase).toString();
var hmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(encrypted, CryptoJS.SHA256(passphrase)).toString();
var transitmessage = hmac + encrypted;

//other side

var transithmac = transitmessage.substring(0, 64);
var transitencrypted = transitmessage.substring(64);
var decryptedhmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(transitencrypted, CryptoJS.SHA256(passphrase)).toString();
alert(transithmac == decryptedhmac);
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(transitencrypted, passphrase).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
alert(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

In theory the IV should also be prepended to the encrypted message before the HMAC call but I wasn't sure how to get the IV back out with crypto-js and I was hoping to keep this example simple enough and unless you expect to be a target of the NSA this should be enough as the IV already modifies the encrypted message.

","Perhaps CryptoJS docs don't mention this explicitly enough, but in order for the crypto algorithm of your choice (AES in your case) to use the exact key and IV you provide they must be passed in as a CJS type WordArray.
One way to get the word arrays is to use parse methods of an encoding of your choice:
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""HEX ENCODING OF THE KEY"");
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""HEX ENCODING OF THE IV"");

after that, all you do should work fine.

","So your problem is the line var encrypted = aesEncryptor.finalize();
This is not the encrypted file, but the final 'chunk' produced by the CryptoJS.AES finalizer.
you need to append that to the end of the window.bits buffer to yield the fully encrypted file.
Also, you shouldn't be using window.bits.push, you should keep hold of a reference to each chunk like this (psuedocode):
var prog;
//then in the loop, if chunk is null assign to chunk or else concat:
loop:
    if(!prog)
        prog = cipher.process()
    else
        prog.concat(cipher.process())

//then finalize
prog.concat(cipher.finalize())

//now you're free to do whatever with the encrypted file:
var ciphertext = prog.toString()

","One important thing to keep in mind is that the chunks may arrive to the encryptor out of order so you either have to keep track of the order that chunks went into aesEncryptor.process so that you can decrypt in the proper order later or queue the chunks and encrypt them in the proper order to begin with.

string original = ""some data to encrypt"";
byte[] encrypted;

{
    // Prepare new Key and IV.
    string passphrase = ""somepassphrase"";
    byte[] saltArray = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""somesalt"");

and it works (DecryptStringFromBytes_Aes returns the original string). 
My question is how do I decrypt encrypted using JavaScript if I have the same passphrase on the client-side as well? I tried using CryptoJS to decrypt it but had no success. The data gets encrypted in a webservice and I tried passing it to JS as a byte array, string, tried encoding it with various encodings but no matter what I did, I couldn't get the original string. What am I doing wrong here and how can I make this work? Is it even doable like this? Could the saltArray encoding or even the usage of the custom passphrase be the cause of my problems?
Here is for example one of my JS tries (using base64 encoding):
var decoded = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(encrypted);
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(decoded, ""somepassphrase"");

"17929107","CryptoJS (HMAC Sha256) giving incorrect output?","Let me start by saying I'm no expert in cryptography algorithms...
I am trying to build a method which formats an HTTP header for Windows Azure - and this header requires part of its message to be encrypted via HMAC with SHA256 (and then also base64 encoded).
I chose to use CryptoJS because it's got an active user community.
First, my code:
_encodeAuthHeader : function (url, params, date) {
    //http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd179428
    var canonicalizedResource = '/' + this.getAccountName() + url;

    /*
     StringToSign = Date + ""\n"" + CanonicalizedResource
     */
    var stringToSign = date + '\n' + canonicalizedResource;
    console.log('stringToSign >> ' + stringToSign)

    var encodedBits = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(stringToSign, this.getAccessKey());
    console.log('encodedBits >> ' + encodedBits);

    var base64Bits = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(encodedBits);
    console.log('base64Bits >> ' + base64Bits);

    var signature = 'SharedKeyLite ' + this.getAccountName() + ':' + base64Bits;
    console.log('signature >> ' + signature);

    return signature;
},

The method successfully returns a ""signature"" with the appropriate piece encrypted/encoded. However, Azure complains that it's not formatted correctly.
Some example output:
stringToSign >> Mon, 29 Jul 2013 16:04:20 GMT\n/senchaazurestorage/Tables

encodedBits >> 6723ace2ec7b0348e1270ccbaab802bfa5c1bbdddd108aece88c739051a8a767

base64Bits >> ZyOs4ux7A0jhJwzLqrgCv6XBu93dEIrs6IxzkFGop2c=

signature >> SharedKeyLite senchaazurestorage:ZyOs4ux7A0jhJwzLqrgCv6XBu93dEIrs6IxzkFGop2c=

Doing some debugging, I am noticing that CryptoJS is not returning the same value (HMAC with SHA256) as alternative implementations. For example, the string ""Mon, 29 Jul 2013 16:04:20 GMT\n/senchaazurestorage/Tables"" appears as:

""6723ace2ec7b0348e1270ccbaab802bfa5c1bbdddd108aece88c739051a8a767"" via CryptoJS
""faa89f45ef029c63d04b8522d07c54024ae711924822c402b2d387d05398fc9f"" via PHP hash_hmac('sha256', ... )

Digging even deeper, I'm seeing that most HMAC/SHA265 algorithms return data which matches the output from PHP... am I missing something in CryptoJS? Or is there a legitimate difference?
","As I mentioned in my first comment, the newline (""\n"") was causing problems. Escaping that (""\ \n"", without the space inbetween) seems to have fixed the inconsistency in HMAC/SHA256 output.
I'm still having problems with the Azure HTTP ""Authorization"" header, but that's another issue.

I probably just don't understand the concept but I have no idea.
The end result from my code is still just a jumbled mess when I display decrypted result.
I found this here:
https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/
The original entry looks like this:
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). It was selected after a 5-year process where 15 competing designs were evaluated.
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js"">    </script>
<script>
    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", ""Secret Passphrase"");

    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, ""Secret Passphrase"");
</script>

CryptoJS supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key.
","You are alerting the raw decrypted object - the default encoding for such is hex. It needs to be converted to a string using the appropriate human-readable encoding:
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>
<script>
var toEncMes = ""This is a secret message."";
var secPas = ""myPassword"";
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(toEncMes, secPas);

alert (encrypted);
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, secPas);
alert (decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)); // <---- note specified encoding
</script>

Of course, the usual cryptographic warning signs still apply: this doesn't ensure your message has not been tampered with, etc.

//Signature
var signature = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256')
signature.update(stoken);
var sig = signature.sign(private_key, 'base64');
console.log(sig);

Both the SToken Values and the Signature Values produce the expected results
if we try something similar using angularjs, the Signature value is incorrect.

And finally here is the view:

Again, just to repeat, the SToken value appears correct but when I show the signature, it is incorrect. I am not quite sure how to deal with this but any assistance would be appreciated. 
","After some research, I realize that I forgot to base64 encode the answer from angularjs
So I changed the controller.js code from this
var signature = sig.sign();

To this:

","I don't know what key.getBytes() is supposed to be. You should simply pass the string to the SHA1 function and get a representation of your choice out of it. This produces a matching hex representation of the byte array from your Java code.

> CryptoJS.SHA1(key).toString()
""7c4a8d09ca3762af61e59520943dc26494f8941b""

If you want to create exactly the same array, you can iterate over the words property of the native representation of CryptoJS. Each integer represents 4 bytes in Big-Endian notation.
var key = ""123456"";
var hash = CryptoJS.SHA1(key);
var byteArray = [];
hash.words.forEach(function(i){ 
  var k;
  for(var j = 3; j >= 0; j--){
    k = (i >> (j*8)) & 0xFF;
    k = k < 128 ? k : -(256 - k);
    byteArray.push(k);
  }

I'm trying do encrypt data that's going to be sent to a RoR-application via AJAX.
I've managed to encrypt a string in Ruby and decrypt it in JavaScript, but now I can't manage to do the reverse.
Here's my JS:
function decrypt(data, key) {
    var index = data.indexOf('!$');
    var iv = data.substr(0, index);
    var crypttext = data.substr(index + 2);

    encrypted = {}
    encrypted.ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(crypttext);

    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key, { iv: CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(iv) });

    return decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
}

function encrypt( data, key ) {
    enc = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt( data, key );

    enc_str = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(enc.iv) + ""!$"" + CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(enc.ciphertext);

    return enc_str;
}
// ...
var key = 'ABCDEF123ABCDEF123ABCDEF123ABCDEF123ABCDEF123';//CryptoJS.SHA256( 'ABCDEF123' ).toString();
var key2 = 'ABCDEF123ABCDEF123ABCDEF123ABCDEF123ABCDEF123_42'; //CryptoJS.SHA256( 'ABCDEF123_42' ).toString();
code = ""123 456""
    uuid = ""0000000000000000000000000000""

var enc_code    = encrypt( code, key );
var enc_uuid    = encrypt( uuid, key2 );

I divided the iv and ciphertext because I had some problems with the Decryption in JS.
Here's the ruby code
def decrypt(string, key)
  salt = nil
  if string.include? '$$:'
    sp = string.split '$$:'
    string = sp[0]
    salt   = sp[1].to_i(16).to_s
  end

  parts = string.split '!$'

  @initialization_vector = Base64.decode64(parts[0])

  aes_decrypt(key, Base64.decode64(parts[1]), salt)
end

def aes(key,string)
  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new(""aes-256-cbc"")
  cipher.encrypt
  cipher.key = key #Digest::SHA256.digest(key)
  cipher.iv = @initialization_vector = cipher.random_iv# + '#'
  cipher_text = cipher.update(string)
  cipher_text << cipher.final
  return  cipher_text
end

def aes_decrypt(key, encrypted, salt = nil)
  p encrypted
  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new(""aes-256-cbc"")
  cipher.decrypt
  cipher.padding = 0 # I Spent a couple of hours with an exception from Cipher, all I had to do was add this line!!
  cipher.key = key #Digest::SHA256.digest(key)
  cipher.iv = encrypted.slice!(0, 16)
  unless salt.nil?
 #   cipher.pkcs5_keyivgen key, salt
  end
  d = cipher.update(encrypted)
  d << cipher.final
end

As you can see I tried to figure out a way to include the salt, but with no luck (Cipher wont accept the salt and asking for an octet)!
The decryption in Ruby just spits out gibbrish.
(The methods work, I've decrypted the string sent to the clientside (which decrypts w/o problems in JS) direct in Ruby, and that works fine!
Here's the weird thing, I tried to decrypt the string in JS right away, but that doesn't work either!
Here's the results:
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt( enc, key, { iv: enc.iv, salt: enc.salt } ).toString() // In encrypt()
// => 31323320343536
// => 30303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030

decrypt( enc_code, key ).toString(); // After encrypt
// => [EMPTY]

My Google-fu is failing me, I've tried most things I've found!
Any ideas??
","The libraries you are using are using the higher layers of OpenSSL. The higher layers support password based encryption. By default, your CryptoJS code seems to use the proprietary Password Based Key Derivation Function from OpenSSL. However, the Ruby code does less by default; it will simply use the key you've put in as a key, you need to do the key derivation yourself.
So if you want to use just a key (which should be random binary data, not text), you should use a custom key and IV in CryptoJS. On the other hand, if you want to use a password (and therefore salt value), you should be using method-i-pkcs5_keyivgen. In that case you may also need to parse the OpenSSL encrypted BLOB.

","Your key is wrong, Java (incorrectly) uses the ASCII representation of the key:
String key = ""1234567890123456789012345678901d"";
...
SecretKeySpec newKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""AES"");

which results in a 32 byte key for AES-256. But your JavaScript uses the Hex decoding of the key:
var key =  CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""1234567890123456789012345678901d"");

which results in a 16 byte key for AES-128.
With wrong keys you will obviously not get the right results.
So you'd either have to encode your key as you did your IV in Java or use a hex decoder (not present in Java by default) or you should ""fix"" your JavaScript to do the same as in Java and use the ASCII encoding of the key string.
Keys, in general, should not be strings.

Additional thoughts: I'm worried about spacing/quoting differences with JSON methods. Perhaps I should loop thru the object/array and use the ""values"" only to produce the string of data to be HMAC'ed? Assuming this can be kept to a single array/object, that should produce a consistent ""values"" string. But, then how do you keep a consistent ordering. I assume it could be ordered by key first.
","As @Pointy mentioned in the comments, the output of JSON.stringify and json_encode may have slight differences in two scenarios:

An object's key/value ordering (objects are unordered)
""Simple"" values

On ""simple"" values, the PHP documentation has this to say:

Like the reference JSON encoder, json_encode() will generate JSON that is a simple value (that is, neither an object nor an array) if given a string, integer, float or boolean as an input value. While most decoders will accept these values as valid JSON, some may not, as the specification is ambiguous on this point.
  To summarise, always test that your JSON decoder can handle the output you generate from json_encode().

If you're worried about the data being 100% faithfully recreated, consider encoding the data before storing it (i.e. base64_encode it).
P.S. If you're going to HMAC the data, you need to 1) only HMAC the values and 2) make sure you always access the values in the same order every time because JSON makes no ordering promises for anything except arrays.

","CryptoJS 'sha3' is not actually using the current SHA-3 standard unfortunately - hence your discrepancy. The code is implementing a version of SHA-3 which was superseded. 

In 2014, NIST made slight changes to the Keccak submission and
  published FIPS 202, which became the official SHA-3 standard in August
  2015.

Quoted from this source:
https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/are-you-really-using-sha-3-or-old-code-c5df31ad2b0
Which goes on to say:

Unfortunately, the readme in Github makes no mention, and the user
  must look at the old site to find the “NOTE: I made a mistake when I
  named this implementation SHA-3. It should be named Keccak.” So any
  dependents of CryptoJS that uses sha3 is using old code that would be
  better described by a term like Keccak. Also, beware of online sha3
  calculators, because some of them have not been updated to SHA-3.

In my another app i am doing this in android and its working fine. But with jquery decryption is not working. Following is the Encryption function I am using:
function encryptText(textvalue, key) {

","In the javascript version of your code, the salt should be a WordArray object not a javascript string. Basically in your two examples, the salts are different and therefore you are getting two different results.
To verify what I am talking about, try the following piece of code in the browser javascript console:
saltWArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
saltString = saltWArray.toString(); // same salt but in String format

var key1 = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""password"", saltWArray, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: 300 });
var key2 = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""password"", saltString, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: 300 });

In the above code, key1 and key2 will be different, because the salts are inherently different even though the salt content is the same.

","The mention of postman changed this. I have a solution for you, but it's not exactly a clean way by any mean.
You'll need to create a request that you will need to execute whenever you open postman. Go as follows:

The purpose of this request is to side-load jsrsasign-js and storing it in a global Postman variable.
Once this is done, you can then use this content elsewhere. For every request you need a RSA256 JWT signature, the following pre-request script will update a variable (here, token) with the token:
var navigator = {};
var window = {};
eval(pm.globals.get(""jsrsasign-js""));

function addIAT(request) {
    var iat = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 257;
    data.iat = iat;

var sHeader = JSON.stringify(header);
var sPayload = JSON.stringify(data);

var sJWT = KJUR.jws.JWS.sign(header.alg, sHeader, sPayload, privateKey);

pm.variables.set('token', sJWT);

In order:
- I define mock window and navigator objects as jsrsasign-js needs them.
- I then eval() the content of what we fetched earlier in order to rehydrate everything
- The rest of your code is simple usage of jsrsasign-js. Your token info is there, and I've defined a private key there. You can change this or use an environment variable; it's just there for demo purposes. I then simply use the rehydrated library to sign it, and set the variable to the value of the signed JWT.

A PEM, as you refer to it, is a container format specifying a combination of public and/or private key. You're using it to sign using HMAC-SHA256, which operates on a shared secret. This obviously isn't going to work (unless you take the poor man's approach and use your public key as the shared secret).
Fortunately enough, there are other signature methods defined in the RFCs. For instance, there is a way to sign using RSA, and a very convenient way of defining a public key as a JSON web key (JWK). We're going to be leveraging both.
I've generated a key pair for testing, they're named out and out.pub. Generation tool is genrsa (and as such, they're an RSA keypair).
In order to sign, we're going to have to change a few things:

We're changing algorithms from HS256 to RS256, as explained above
We're going to need a new library to do the signing itself, as crypto-js does not support asymmetric key crypto. We'll fall back to the native crypto module, though there are pure-JS alternatives

The code:
var CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");
var keyFileContent = require(""fs"").readFileSync(""./out"");
var pubkey = require(""fs"").readFileSync(""./out.pub"");
var base64url = require(""base64url"");
var nJwt = require(""njwt"");
function addIAT(request) {
    var iat = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 257;
    data.iat = iat;
    return data;
}


var header = {
    ""typ"": ""JWT"",
    ""alg"": ""RS256""
};

var data = {
    ""fname"": ""name"",
    ""lname"": ""name"",
    ""email"": ""email@domain.com"",
    ""password"": ""abc123$""
};

data = addIAT(data);

// encode header
var stringifiedHeader = JSON.stringify(header);
var encodedHeader = base64url(stringifiedHeader);

// encode data
var stringifiedData = JSON.stringify(data);
var encodedData = base64url(stringifiedData);

// build token
var token = encodedHeader + ""."" + encodedData;

// sign token
var signatureAlg = require(""crypto"").createSign(""sha256"");
signatureAlg.update(token);
var signature = signatureAlg.sign(keyFileContent);
signature = base64url(signature);
var signedToken = token + ""."" + signature;

console.log(signedToken);

// Verify
var verifier = new nJwt.Verifier();
verifier.setSigningAlgorithm('RS256');
verifier.setSigningKey(pubkey);
verifier.verify(signedToken, function() {
  console.log(arguments);
});

And that's it! It's quite literally that simple, although I would not recommend rewriting the sign() function from crypto from scratch. Leave it to a library that has had thorough inspection by the community, and crypto is pretty serious business.

","Your code works fine on my end, and the long sequence of hex characters seems perfectly normal to me.
Your ciphertext is always 66 characters long (in hex) because you're storing the 32 character IV, the 2 character delimiter (""AP""), and the 32 character (256 bit) ciphertext. Your code uses padding, and as such, the ciphertext will always be the next multiple of 16 bytes (32 hex characters) up from the length of the plaintext, and that's why you're getting such a long string of hex characters for a plaintext string that's only 1 character.
Unfortunately for you, padding is required for AES (at least in the mode you're using), otherwise it wouldn't function.

Thank you
","Yes. You can get a ciphertext of 5 bytes (or 10 hexadecimal characters) or less. But there are catches for such short ciphertexts.
Basically there are two ways. I'll start with the easier one.
Counter mode (CTR)
You can use CTR (counter) mode with a nonce. Encrypting X bytes with CTR mode gives you exactly X bytes as a result. CTR mode does not require padding of the plaintext to N times the block size.
This nonce (number-used-once) must be a unique number, or your plaintext is in direct danger of being exposed. You cannot just rely on a random number; a 4 byte random number has a high probability of repetition because of the birthday bound.
So you either need to store the nonce separately or include a 4 byte nonce in your ciphertext. However, if you ever manage to reuse the nonce then you're screwed. For such a low amount of bytes that means that you basically have to keep a 4 byte counter, which means having to store state.
Generally CTR mode encryption routines require you to supply an IV rather than a nonce. This is simply the initial counter value. You must construct this value by getting the nonce, and then right-padding it with zero valued bytes until you get to 16 bytes, the block size of AES.
You can find sample code here, don't forget to upvote. Rob also has provided some sample code in his answer.
Format preserving encryption (FPE)
With format preserving encryption the output of the encryption uses the exact number of bits or even values as the possible values of the input. That sounds great, but FPE consists of a bunch of relatively complex algorithms. Basically you'd have to find a crypto library in JavaScript to implement it.
Note that with FPE the same message will always encrypt to the same ciphertext. Depending on the application this may or may not be a problem.

Notes:

You are using hexadecimal encoding, that's not the most dense encoding out there, you could use base 64 or even ASCII 85 encoding.
It's more efficient to first concatenate the IV and ciphertext as bytes and then perform the encoding. If you have a static size for the IV you can simply use a constant rather than a separator.
Your key should consist of random bytes, not a text string. Passwords need to be converted using password hashing.

Problem is encryption data length is 66 even for text is 1
So is there any encryption and decryption method should give different encryption data at every time with less than 10 characters for text is 1(according to my example)
Thank you
","Maarten covers most of the major points that I wanted to make, so this is just some elaboration and an example of it in Node.
The changes from your code are:

Encode in Base64 rather than Hex. This is much more space-efficient. It would be even better to just use Buffers and not create a string at all; then we could have a 9-byte nonce rather than a 5-byte nonce.
Get rid of separator character between the IV/nonce and the ciphertext. We know how long the IV/nonce is; we don't need a separator.
Use CTR mode rather than CBC mode. This makes output length equal to input length.
Use a nonce rather than an IV. Randomly choose the nonce from a 2^40 space. (Randomly choosing a CTR nonce is very dangerous in general. See below for why it might be acceptable in your use case; it is still never recommended.)
Fix password generation by adding PBKDF2 (you could also just use randomBytes). Your password is highly insecure. It's an ASCII string, which means it represents a tiny fraction of the AES-256 keyspace. On the order of 0.000000000002% of the keyspace. That's how much less secure this is than AES-256.

As Maarten notes, it is quite dangerous for CTR mode to duplicate a Key+Nonce pair. If someone does that, they can learn the XOR of the two original messages. With that, they have a good chance of decrypting both messages. For example, if you duplicated your key+nonce on two messages and the attacker used that to discover that their XOR was 3 and knew that the encrypted text was a capital letter, they would know that the two messages had to be one of these:
[('A', 'B'), ('D', 'G'), ('E', 'F'), ('H', 'K'), ('I', 'J'), ('L', 'O'),
 ('M', 'N'), ('P', 'S'), ('Q', 'R'), ('T', 'W'), ('U', 'V')]

This kind of information is devastating for structured data like human language or computer protocols. It can very quickly be used to decrypt the whole message. Key+nonce reuse is how WEP was broken. (When you do this by hand, it's basically identical to solving a cryptogram puzzle you'd find in the newspaper.) It is less powerful the more random the encrypted data is, and the less context it provides.
With a random 5-byte nonce, there is a 50% likelihood of a collision after about 1.3M encryptions. With a random 8-byte nonce, there is a 50% likelihood of a collision after about 5.3B encryptions. sqrt(pi/2 * 2^bits)
In cryptographic terms, this is a completely broken. It may or may not be sufficient for your purposes. To do it correctly (which I do not do below), as Maarten notes, you should keep track of your counter and increment it for every encryption rather than using a random one. After 2^40 encryptions (~1T), you change your key. 
Assuming that leaking information about two messages per million is acceptable, this is how you would implement that.
const crypto = require('crypto');

const ENCRYPTION_KEY = 'Must256bytes(32characters)secret';
const SALT = 'somethingrandom';
const IV_LENGTH = 16;

const NONCE_LENGTH = 5; // Gives us 8-character Base64 output. The higher this number, the better

function encrypt(key, text) {
  let nonce = crypto.randomBytes(NONCE_LENGTH);
  let iv = Buffer.alloc(IV_LENGTH)
  nonce.copy(iv)

  let cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-ctr', key, iv);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(text.toString());
  message = Buffer.concat([nonce, encrypted, cipher.final()]);
  return message.toString('base64')
}

function decrypt(key, text) {
  let message = Buffer.from(text, 'base64')
  let iv = Buffer.alloc(IV_LENGTH)
  message.copy(iv, 0, 0, NONCE_LENGTH)
  let encryptedText = message.slice(NONCE_LENGTH)
  let decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-ctr', key, iv);
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedText);
  try{
    decrypted = Buffer.concat([decrypted, decipher.final()]);
    return decrypted.toString();
  }catch(Err){
    return 'NULL';
  }
}

// You could do this one time and record the result. Or you could just
// generate a random 32-byte key and record that. But you should never
// pass an ASCII string to the encryption function.
let key = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(ENCRYPTION_KEY, SALT, 10000, 32, 'sha512')

let encrypted = encrypt(key, ""X"")
console.log(encrypted + "" : "" + encrypted.length)

let decrypted = decrypt(key, encrypted)
console.log(decrypted)

","When you do below, WordArray.create method uses your numbers as 32-bits integers:
salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create([-67, -85, 13, -28, 75, 112, -126, 103]);

In this case your salt in hex is:
ffffffbdffffffab0000000dffffffe40000004b00000070ffffff8200000067

If you convert javascript Array object to Int8Array, CryptoJS will create the same salt as in Java:
salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(new Int8Array([-67, -85, 13, -28, 75, 112, -126, 103]));

Warning: It is extremely difficult to get cryptographic code right. It can be even harder in JavaScript, where you often lack control over the execution environment and (as discussed below) a lack of language support has led to inconsistent conventions. I have not done enough research about the CryptoJS library to know about its design or security, or whether it is being used safely in this context.
Please do not rely on any of this code to be genuinely secure without a professional audit.

A common issue when working with cryptographic code in JavaScript has been that there was no built-in way to represent binary data. This has been resolved in modern engines (with types Blobs and TypedArrays in the browser and Buffers in Node.js), but there is still a lot code that doesn't take advantage of this for historical or compatibility reasons.
Without these built-in types, one common convention (used by the built-in atob and btoa functions) is to use the built-in string type to hold binary data. A JavaScript string is really a list of two-byte values (usually containing UCS-2/UTF-16-encoded Unicode characters). Users wanting to store binary data will often just use the lower byte, ignoring the higher byte entirely.
If you're only handling ASCII-compatible data, you might get away with ignoring these details when using code like this (i.e. things will work -- but there may be subtle security consequences). This is because text encoded as ASCII looks the same as text encoded as UTF-16 with the high bytes stripped out. But when you venture beyond that, you need to do some encoding.
The most correct thing (aside from using a real binary type) to do would be to take the input string of characters, encode it to UTF-8, and put that data in the lower bytes of an output string. However, JavaScript doesn't provide a built-in function to do that. As a crude but simple alternative, the encodeURIComponent function will encode any valid unicode string into a UTF-8 based representation of entirely URL-safe characters, which are all ASCII-compatible. In the case of your code, that would mean something like this:
var key = ""123"";
var content = ""secret text with an emoji, 🎮"";

var encrypted = aes_encrypt(key, encodeURIComponent(content));

var decrypted = decodeURIComponent(aes_decrypt(key, encrypted));

If you have a lot of non-URL-safe characters, this could result in the encoded data being much larger than necessary, but it should be safe. Also, encodeURIComponent will apparently throw an error for strings that contain ""unpaired surrogate characters"". I don't think these should occur in ordinary input, but someone could craft them.
I expect that there is a more-correct way to handle things like this in CryptoJS, but I am unaware of it.  Please consider looking into this further if you're planning to deploy this code for public use.

This works because if a string is passed as content to CryptoJS.AES.encrypt then it will be automatically parsed as UTF-8, but you need to convert it back to UTF-8 after decryption yourself. This is done with .toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8).

This code only demonstrates that CryptoJS handles UTF-8 already very well. This is not secure, because 

MD5 with a single iteration is used for key derivation from the password. You would need to use something like PBKDF2, which CryptoJS provides. (Don't forget to use a random IV every time. It doesn't have to be secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext.)
The ciphertext is not authenticated, which makes it unlikely to detect (malicious) manipulation of the encrypted data. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme with a strong MAC like HMAC-SHA256, which CryptoJS provides.

","Quoting the JSFiddle from the OP's comment:
var salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
// Key and iv should be based on the same value. In this example ""1111""
var key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(""1111"", salt, { keySize: 128/32 });
var iv = key; // Not sure what should be here!!

You are generating a key from a random salt (see first line), and using that same key as initialization vector... and yet you expect a constant result? (as expected, the result changes in each invocation).
Fix it to use the exact same bytes for key and iv used by the SecretKeySpec and IvParameterSpec from the java code (which you can query using their getEncoded() methods). I do not know whether the AES SecretKeySpec uses PBKDF2 or another key derivation function -- but it should be easy to test. Find the one that matches and stick to it.
Beware also that the default padding in CryptoJS is PKCS7 (see the docs on ""block modes and padding""); this may differ strongly from the PKCS5 that you specify in your first line of Java code.

the last line changes every time this is run (run it on page load) - same values provided every time, output is different. 
How it is supposed to work:
Decryption Instructions:
1. A static, secret key will be shared which will be used for decryption (Secret Key TBD).
    a. HASH the secret key with SHA256, encode it to Hex and use the first 32 characters. This will be used as the KEY when decrypting.
2. Two pieces of information will be sent via the POST method
    a. Parameter “AN”: A Base64 Encoded, AES-256-CBC Encrypted string which will represent the Account Number when decrypted
    b. Parameter “IV”: A Base64 Encoded initialization vector (IV) string which will be used in decrypting the Account Number string
3. Base64 Decode both parameters
4. Using the AES-256-CBC method, decrypt the encrypted string (which was base64 decoded as part of Step #3) with the initialization vector decoded in Step #3 and the hash created in Step #1a
5. The decryption should then provide you the account number.

Java code
","There many issues with your code. It is hard to say what is really responsible for the non-deterministic decryption. I guess it is the fact that you're passing the key as a string which means that CryptoJS will assume that it is a password and try to use EVP_BytesToKey to derive a key from that. Since the salt is not set, CryptoJS probably has a bug that it generates a random salt for decryption (which it should not). You need to parse the key into a WordArray if you want to manually provide the key.
The other main issue is using non-CryptoJS methods for decoding (atob) which means that you get some data format that cannot be directly read by CryptoJS. CryptoJS relies on the internal WordArray for representing all binary data or expects all strings to be UTF-8-encoded.
Working code:


// Key and take the hash of it
var secretKey = 'TESTING123Secret_Key';
var secretKeyHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(secretKey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex).slice(0,32);
secretKeyHash = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(secretKeyHash);

// Base 64 encoded values
var accountNumberBase64 = 'nxjYfo4Stw63YBEcnjo3oQ==';
var initializationVectorBase64 = 'HnNcvu9AP9yl09APWkWnDQ==';

var ct = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(accountNumberBase64);
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(initializationVectorBase64);

// Use crypto to decrypt
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({
    ciphertext: ct
  },
  secretKeyHash, {
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding,
    iv: iv
  }
);
console.log('   decrypted, by hand: ' + decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

The encrypted data from both this  options are coming different hence, not able to work this out.
So far what I have seen is,

node crypto createCipheriv method takes only 32 byte buffer and if I

If I convert the 16 byte key to hex encoded string, the encrypted value changes and does not match with the C# implementation.
I can't change the C# implementation as its already in production and been used by multiple applications.
So there seems to be an issue with generating key from salt and password in node js, matching what is done in C# and I'm not able to figure that out.

Code can be tested in the below link:

","It seems that you are creating a AES-128 instance in your C# code, because you are using 16 bytes keylen.
AES-256 keylen is 32 bytes, not 16 bytes.
Bugs in code:

Since you set 16 bytes for key in C#, it uses AES-128, not AES-256. So you need to change node.js to AES-128 or change generated key to 32 bytes in both sides.
Since you are using text string salt and password(not base64 encoded), your node.js side uses incorrect pbkdf2Sync parameters.
IV len for AES algorithm in 16 bytes and you cannot use shorter ones.

Since you wanted AES-256 here are your changed to both sides:
C# side:
String iv = Convert.ToString(""SOME_IV_SOME_IV_""); // 16 bytes IV
....
byte[] key = spec.GetBytes(32); // 32 bytes key

node.js side:
iv = 'SOME_IV_SOME_IV_' // 16 bytes IV similar to C#
...
// Bugs in this function
function createHashPassword(){
    // Change parameters to `base64` only if salt and password are base64. it may be true for salt, but it is can rarely be correct for password.
    let nodeCrypto = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(Buffer.from(password), Buffer.from(salt), 65536, 32, 'sha1');

    return nodeCrypto;
};

IMPORTANT NOTES:

Remember that IV must be selected as a random buffer(neither fixed not text) and since it seems that you are sending it over network, you need to send IV with it too.
SALT must be a random buffer(not text) and fixed on both sides.
i suggest to use over 100000 iteration for PBKDF2 at least.

Security considerations:
PBEwithMD5andDES should not be used and there are better alternatives like PBEWithHmacSHA256AndAES_128 which require a slightly different approach.
The number of iterations must be large (a thousand to a million) in order to make it hard to brute-force the password. DES only provides 56 bits of security, so it is even possible to brute-force the key directly with today's means.
The salt must be randomly generated in order to achieve semantic security. The salt itself doesn't need to be secret. Since it has a known length it can be simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
var crypto = require('crypto');

key = 'testing'
plaintext = '437217'
iv = 'aw90rela942f65u2'

crypto.pbkdf2('testing', null, 100, 32, 'AES-256-CBC', (err, derivedKey) => {

var decryptedPassword = decipher.update(encryptedPassword, 'base64', 'utf8');
decryptedPassword += decipher.final('utf8');

console.log('original  :', plaintext);

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

","PBKDF2 is a great idea and is what the PHP code should have done in the first place. Unfortunately what happens inside passwordDeriveBytes() is nowhere near PBKDF2. You need to reproduce the looping like what happens inside passwordDeriveBytes() if you want to match it.
Oh and ""Salt must be a buffer"" is solved by converting the IV to a Buffer with Buffer.from(iv) (that is also a sign that a good IV should not be a string but random bytes).
const crypto = require('crypto');

function sha1(input) {
    return crypto.createHash('sha1').update(input).digest();
}

function passwordDeriveBytes(password, salt, iterations, len) {
    var key = Buffer.from(password + salt);
    for(var i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        key = sha1(key);
    }
    if (key.length < len) {
        var hx = passwordDeriveBytes(password, salt, iterations - 1, 20);
        for (var counter = 1; key.length < len; ++counter) {
            key = Buffer.concat([key, sha1(Buffer.concat([Buffer.from(counter.toString()), hx]))]);
        }
    }
    return Buffer.alloc(len, key);

var password = 'testing';
var plaintext = '437217';
var iv = 'aw90rela942f65u2';

//var key = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, '', 100, 32, 'sha1'); // How it should be
var key = passwordDeriveBytes(password, '', 100, 32); // How it is

var cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', key, Buffer.from(iv));
var decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-cbc', key, Buffer.from(iv));

var part1 = cipher.update(plaintext, 'utf8');
var part2 = cipher.final();

","""AES-128 in CBC Mode"" is not a data format. There is no universal way of writing encrypted data along with the required metadata. You need to know what you've been handed and how it was generated. Then you can work out how to implement the same with CryptoJS in most cases. In particular, you need to know the following:

What algorithm? ""AES-128"" is ambiguous. It could mean ""AES with a 128-bit key size"" or it could mean ""AES with a 128-block size and some other key size.""
What key size (see above)
What mode? (You've answered this: it's CBC.)
What is the padding? The most common is PKCS#7, but there could be no padding. (For CBC mode, it is almost certainly PKCS#7.)
What is the IV? There is always an IV for CBC. Sometimes that IV is incorrectly set to NULL (this makes CBC less secure). It is possible that the IV is generated somehow from a password (this is how OpenSSL works).
Do you have a good key, an insecure key, or a password. A good key is a series of random bytes the size of your key. An insecure key is when a password is treated like a key (by copying human-typed letters into the key buffer). This is insanely insecure, but very common.
If you have a proper password, then what KDF and parameters were used to convert it to a key? For example, did they use the OpenSSL KDF or PBKDF2 or bcrypt or scrypt?
Is there any other metadata, such as an HMAC? (An HMAC is required to secure AES-CBC. Without it, an attacker can sometimes modify the ciphertext to decrypt to a desired plaintext.)

When you have these answers, then you can work out how to implement it with CryptoJS.

Yes, you can do that and it is called Progressive Hashing.
var md5 = CryptoJS.algo.MD5.create();

md5.update(""file part 1"");
md5.update(""file part 2"");
md5.update(""file part 3"");

var hash = md5.finalize();



Can I specify any amount of Byte such as 2000 Character of a file to generate HASH Value then generating for large files.


There's an HTML5Rocks article on how one can use File.slice to pass a sliced file to the FileReader:
var blob = file.slice(startingByte, endindByte);
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

Full solution
I have combined both. The tricky part was to synchronize the file reading, because FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer() is asynchronous. I've written a small series function which is modeled after the series function of async.js. It has to be done one after the other, because there is is no way to get to the internal state of the hashing function of CryptoJS.
Additionally, CryptoJS doesn't understand what an ArrayBuffer is, so it has to be converted to its native data representation, which is the so-called WordArray:
function arrayBufferToWordArray(ab) {
  var i8a = new Uint8Array(ab);
  var a = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < i8a.length; i += 4) {
    a.push(i8a[i] << 24 | i8a[i + 1] << 16 | i8a[i + 2] << 8 | i8a[i + 3]);
  }
  return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(a, i8a.length);
}

The other thing is that hashing is a synchronous operation where there is no yield to continue execution elsewhere. Because of this, the browser will freeze since JavaScript is single threaded. The solution is to use Web Workers to off-load the hashing to a different thread so that the UI thread keeps responsive.
Web workers expect the script file in their constructors, so I used this solution by Rob W to have an inline script.
function series(tasks, done){
    if(!tasks || tasks.length === 0) {
        done();
    } else {
        tasks[0](function(){
            series(tasks.slice(1), done);
        });
    }
}

function webWorkerOnMessage(e){
    if (e.data.type === ""create"") {
        md5 = CryptoJS.algo.MD5.create();
        postMessage({type: ""create""});
    } else if (e.data.type === ""update"") {
        function arrayBufferToWordArray(ab) {
            var i8a = new Uint8Array(ab);
            var a = [];
            for (var i = 0; i < i8a.length; i += 4) {
                a.push(i8a[i] << 24 | i8a[i + 1] << 16 | i8a[i + 2] << 8 | i8a[i + 3]);
            }
            return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(a, i8a.length);
        }
        md5.update(arrayBufferToWordArray(e.data.chunk));

"29927385","Spring 4 Encryptors vs cryptojs","I am processing encryption using Spring 4 Encryptors class this way:
String salt = KeyGenerators.string().generateKey();
TextEncryptor textEncryptor = Encryptors.text(""MY_SECRET_KEY"", salt);
textEncryptor.encrypt(json);

In the client javascript I am trying to decrypt using CryptoJS
var uncrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(serverEncrypted, ""MY_SECRET_KEY"");
$(""#encrypted-data"").val(uncrypted);

I am guessing I need to revert the Hex encoding part, but I don't understand what needs to be done.
I tried parsing before decrypting, but nothing good out of it.
CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(serverEncrypted)

The spring documentation says the text method will encrypt in the hex value in the ""standard"" encryption method and which is 256-bit AES using PKCS #5's PBKDF2
[Search progress]
This is how Spring creates its key:
PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, 1024, 256);
SecretKey secretKey = newSecretKey(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"", keySpec);
SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(secretKey.getEncoded(), ""AES"");

And the crypting:
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new IvParameterSpec(iv));

iv is a 8 bytes secured random array and is prepended to the encrypted data.
","After some research, I find out a solution, how to combine Spring 4 Encryptors and CryptoJS.
Spring use in its Encryptors 256-bit AES using PKCS #5's PBKDF2 as provided in the documentation - Spring Crypto docs with IV size equals 16 bytes. That info is crucial when creating code in CryptoJS. Another thing to remember is to use the same salt and iv during whole process of encryption/decryption one message. Armed with this info we can start coding (in this example I encrypt message in CryptoJS and decrypt in Spring):
CryptoJS
const keySize = 256;
const ivSize = 128;
const iterations = 1024;

function encrypt(msg, pass) {
    const salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128 / 8);

    const key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(pass, salt, {
        keySize: keySize / 32,
        iterations: iterations
    });

    const iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(ivSize / 8);

    const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msg, key, {
        iv: iv,
        padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7,
        mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC

    });

    // salt, iv will be hex 32 in length
    // append them to the ciphertext for use  in decryption
    return salt.toString() + iv.toString() + encrypted.ciphertext.toString();
}

As you can see result of all encryption is concatenation of salt + iv + encryptedMessage. What is also important that in Spring code I found that key is created with 256 length and in 1024 iterations:
PBEKeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), Hex.decode(salt), 1024, 256);

Now this prepared result we can take to our Spring code and decrypt:
private static String decrypt(String encryptedData, String keyStr) {
        final String salt = encryptedData.substring(0, 32);
        final String encryptedPart = encryptedData.substring(32);
        final TextEncryptor textEncryptor = Encryptors.text(keyStr, salt);
        return textEncryptor.decrypt(encryptedPart);
}

Spring AES encryptor will cut part with IV and use it for decryption process by itself. Of course everything will has to be Hex encoded, but that's how Spring TextEncrytpors works.
The reverse procedure (encrypt in Spring and decrypt in CryptoJS) will be pretty much the same. In CryptoJS we have to extract salt and iv:
const keySize = 256;

function decrypt (encryptedMessage, pass) {
  var salt = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(encryptedMessage.substr(0, 32));
  var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(encryptedMessage.substr(32, 32))
  var encrypted = encryptedMessage.substring(64);

  var key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(pass, salt, {
      keySize: keySize / 32,
      iterations: iterations
    });

  var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key, { 
    iv: iv, 
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC

  })
  return decrypted;
}

I hope it will help somebody :)

    const jwt   = require('jsonwebtoken');
    const pass  = crypto.randomBytes(256).toString('hex');
    const A     = {algorithm:'HS256'};

      console.log('err    ',err);

      res.send({error:err, text:decoded});
   });

I would like to replace 'pass' with an 'RSA 256 SHA', and A with {algorithm:'RS256'}
In node crypto JS's documentation I see the command
const sign = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');

to create the rsa-sha256 
However then the documentation has the function
getPrivateKeySomehow()

Which is not defined or part of crypto.getPrivateKeySomehow() 
So I guess I just need help getting the RSA-SHA-256 string returned from crypto, so that I can pass that into jsonwebtoken to sign my JWT.
Note: I do not want to read a private.key from a static file on my server because i see having a single private key for all my users as too big a security risk, hence why i am generating my own 256 bytes passwords and storing them off-site (not included in this post)
also, i'm not sure if i should do something like this (without using something like openssl from command line?)
const begin = '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n';
const enc   = crypto.randomBytes(256).toString('base64') + '\n';
const end   = '-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----'
const pass = sign.sign(begin + enc + end);
const A = {algorithm:'RS256'};
const token = jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, pass, A);

","Take a look at this example bellow:

        modulusLength: 1024,
        publicKeyEncoding: {

        privateKeyEncoding: {
        type: 'pkcs8',
        format: 'pem'
        }
    }, (err, publicKey, privateKey) => {
        // sign String

        signerObject.update(str);
        var signature = signerObject.sign({key:privateKey,padding:crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PSS_PADDING}, ""base64"");
        console.info(""signature: %s"", signature);

}

Steps:

First you create an key pair with crypto.generateKeyPair('rsa', { ... desired key options
Create a Sign object - crypto.createSign(""RSA-SHA256"")
The string wanted to be signed - SignerObject.update(str)
Sign the string with your private key - signerObject.sign(

","I don't have direct experience with CryptoJS, but many years of experience with a variety of other crypto libraries.  It's almost certainly the case the CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects a different ciphertext format than the one you're using.  Your ciphertext is the contanenation of two separate Base64-encoded entities:
Base64(IV) + Base64(Enc(Message))
If CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects the IV to be specified as part of the ciphertext (which it may not), and expects Base64-encoded ciphertext input at all (which it may not), then I would try passing:
Base64( (binary IV) + (binary Enc(Message)) )
Looking at the CryptoJS doc, I share your frustration with it.  But there's an encryption example with ""manually specified IV"" that may provide a clue.

","I ran into this problem as well and unfortunately it was very tricky to get pycrypto to talk to crypto-js.  Here are the combination that worked for me:

Use MODE_CFB with segment_size=128 when encrypting in Python
You must pad your string with Pkcs7 as per RFC 2315 [Page 21]
Once you have received the base64 version of ciphertext in JS, you need to wrap it in
CryptoJS.lib.CipherParams.create({ ... })

Thank You,
","You are correct. By using a randomly generated key/iv, your encrypted password string will always be different, even though it will decrypt to the same value. So, you won't be able to compare encrypted strings the way you are doing it.
I think the first question you should ask yourself is, do you really need to be able to decrypt your passwords once they are stored in the database? If not, you might be better off using a simple hash. You can use Node's built-in Crypto package for that -- and that is what I typically use to store hashed passwords. I have a few utility methods that I put into a Utils package, like:
const crypto = require('crypto');

/**
 * hashPassword creates a password hash from the supplied password and
 * salt values.
 *
 * @param {string} password
 * @param {string} salt
 * @returns {string}
 */
function hashPassword(password, salt) {
    let seed = sha1Base64(password, salt);
    return sha256Hex(seed);
}

/**
 * sha1Base64 returns a signature using the supplied string and key.
 *
 * @param {string} str
 * @param {string} key
 * @returns {string}

The hashPassword function will create a 64 character string of hex digits. You get the general idea of hashing the password to store it in the database and then hashing the user's password on submission of the login form. Same thing here, only this doesn't require any outside packages. 
However, you will still need to use the same salt each time. You can assign a system-wide salt through an environment variable (more secure), keep one in the database either on a per-user or per-account basis (less secure), or put one in a config file somewhere (probably a bad idea). It really depends on what you are trying to protect as to how fanatical you have to be -- are you creating a login area for a personal blog or a consumer-facing website for Chase Bank? Just make sure your salt is sufficiently long and random. You can use a function to generate a random string of whatever length you want:
/**
 * randomString returns a random alphanumeric string of the specified length.
 *
 * @param {number} [length]
 * @param {boolean} [special]
 * @returns {string}
 */
function randomString(length = 10, special = false) {
    let chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    if (special) chars += '-_%!@#$^&*';
    let cLength = chars.length,
        sRandom = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        sRandom += chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * cLength)];
    }

    return sRandom;
}

For most of the stuff I've ever done, using a hash like this is sufficient.
Hope this helps!

"20522661","How to calculate a 256-bit HMAC_SHA3 hash with CryptoJS?","Recent CryptoJS versions support SHA3 hashing. 
SHA3 can output different hash sizes, including 512-bit (default) and 256-bit. These two work fine:
var sha3_512_hash = CryptoJS.SHA3( 'test' );
var sha3_256_hash = CryptoJS.SHA3( 'test' , { outputLength:256 } );

Similarly, CryptoJS can also calculate HMAC values. However, I can't figure out how to change the default output size there:
var sha3_512_hmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA3( 'test' , 'key' );
var sha3_256_hmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA3( 'test' , 'key' , { outputLength:256 } );

The first works OK (the result is a 512-bit hmac value) but the second is the same (i.e. also 512-bit), as if it ignores the {outputLength:256} parameter!
Here's a live example: http://jsfiddle.net/M8xf3/ (using hmac-sha3.js from CryptoJS 3.1.2)
Does anyone know how to create 256-bit SHA3-based HMAC hashes?
P.S. For the SHA2 family of functions, CryptoJS has separate Hmac functions for each output size (that's HmacSHA256 and HmacSHA512). But this doesn't seem to be the case for SHA3?
","This doesn't answer the actual question, but note that with SHA3 you don't really need HMAC hashes. Unlike SHA1 and SHA2 and MD5, SHA3 is not vulnerable to length-extension attacks.
Therefore with SHA3 it would suffice to just prepend or append the secret key to your input.
Or, if you're paranoid of a single hash step becoming compromised (not to be expected in the foreseeable future, especially not with SHA3, but still) you could do something like SHA3(key+SHA3(key+data)) or SHA3(key+SHA3(key+data)+data) (obviously with ""+"" denoting binary concatenation).

","You can just edit hmac-sha3.js and change the outputLength to 256-bit instead of 512-bit.

Open hmac-sha3.js file, using your text editor.
Find ""{outputLength:512}"" and replace it with ""{outputLength:256}""

Then the hash output will be 256-bit in length.
To be sure that you did not messed up things, double check your 256-bit hmac-sha3 output with some test cases available on the internet, for example: http://www.di-mgt.com.au/hmac_sha3_testvectors.html

export const hashString= (str: string): string => {

I expect hash to be of type string, as specified in the documentation of the crypto-js implementation. But the function returns an object, that contains a wordarray. 
I also tried calling
hash.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex) 

but that didn't work, because typescript also assumes that hash will be a string. So a parameterized toString function is not allowed. 
What am I doing wrong?

How get same HMAC(SHA1) UTF8 value on JS?
","I was found a way for get UTF-8 RAW. 
Used ""convertWordArrayToUint8Array()"" from here:
https://gist.github.com/getify/7325764
and just decode it.
var wordArr = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(buf, bufferedSecret);
var utf8Arr = convertWordArrayToUint8Array(wordArr);
var string = new TextDecoder('utf-8').decode(utf8Arr);

Encryption alerts are coming but not decryption. Why and where it is failing
","I think you have only a typo in the line var decrypted = decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8); it should be var decrypted = decrypt.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8).
After this you are getting a decoderesult and decrypted. But decrypt.iv still returns undefined. Not sure what's wrong here.

See https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#The_Hasher_Output

The hash you get back isn't a string yet. It's a WordArray object. When you use a WordArray object in a string context, it's automatically converted to a hex string.
You can convert a WordArray object to other formats by explicitly calling the toString method and passing an encoder.

Has anyone an idea what I am doing wrong?
","The problem is that encryptedText is a string which is OpenSSL formatted. It is not the pure ciphertext which you get from the ciphertext property after encryption:
var ct = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, key, {iv: iv}).ciphertext;

The Cipher.process function only accepts a WordArray or the data string and encryptedText is neither. You either need to use CryptoJS.format.OpenSSL.parse() to retrieve the ciphertext WordArray:
var ct = CryptoJS.format.OpenSSL.parse(encryptedText).ciphertext;

or directly retrieve ciphertext when you encrypt it like in the first snippet.
After that, you can do:
var decrypted = cipher.process(ct);
decrypted = decrypted.concat(cipher.finalize());

I'm also not sure why you stringify as Base64 and then use atob, because there is an easier way to get the original string back:
console.log(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

","If you want to create a key value from a list of byte values, your best bet is to use the hex encoder function, CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse:
CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('48656c6c6f2c20576f726c6421');

This will parse your input string as a list of two-character pairs that each described a byte value. In this case, the hex values would be 48, 65, 6c, 6c, 6f, etc. You can pass the result of the parse call directly into the encrypt/decrypt methods as the key parameter. (The result is a CryptoJS type called ""WordArray,"" but you don't need to worry about the mechanics of this type; just pass it in as the key paramemter.)
If you want to transform an array of numbers to a hex string, you can do this easily with a simple loop and .toString(16):
var byteArr = [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44],

"40848757","CryptoJS - Decrypt an encrypted file","I'm trying to write an application to do end-to-end encryption for files with JS in browser. However I don't seem to be able to get all files decrypted correctly.
TL;DR As it's impractical to encrypt files bigger than 1MB as a whole, I'm trying to encrypt them chunk by chunk. After doing so I try to write the encrypted words (resulted from CryptoJS's WordArray) into a blob. As for decryption I read the files and split them to chunks according to map generated while encrypting the chunks and try to decrypt them. The problem is decrypted result is 0 bits!
I guess I'm not reading the chunks while decrypting correctly. Please take a look at the code below for the function getBlob (writing data to the blob) and the last part of decryptFile for reading chunks.
More explanation
I'm using CryptoJS AES with default settings.
Right now my code looks like this:
function encryptFile (file, options, resolve, reject) {
  if (!options.encrypt) {
    return resolve(file)
  }
  if (!options.processor || !options.context) {
    return reject('No encryption method.')
  }

  function encryptBlob (file, optStart, optEnd) {
    const start = optStart || 0
    let stop = optEnd || CHUNK_SIZE
    if (stop > file.size - 1) {
      stop = file.size
    }

    const blob = file.slice(start, stop)
    const fileReader = new FileReader()

    fileReader.onloadend = function () {
      if (this.readyState !== FileReader.DONE) return

      const index = Math.ceil(optStart / CHUNK_SIZE)
      const result = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(this.result)
      encryptedFile[index] = encrypt(result)

      chunksResolved++
      if (chunksResolved === count) {
        const {sigBytes, sigBytesMap, words} = getCipherInfo(encryptedFile)
        const blob = getBlob(sigBytes, words)

        resolve(blob, Object.keys(sigBytesMap))
      }
    }
    fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob)
  }

  let chunksResolved = 0
  const encryptedFile = []
  const CHUNK_SIZE = 1024*1024
  const count = Math.ceil(file.size / CHUNK_SIZE)
  const encrypt = value => options.processor.call(
    options.context, value, 'file',
    (v, k) => CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(v, k))

  for (let start = 0; (start + CHUNK_SIZE) / CHUNK_SIZE <= count; start+= CHUNK_SIZE) {
    encryptBlob(file, start, start + CHUNK_SIZE - 1)
  }
}

As you can see I'm trying to read the file chunk by chunk (each chunk is 1MB or fileSize % 1MB) as ArrayBuffer, converting it to WordArray for CryptoJS to understand and encrypt it.
After encrypting all the chunks I try to write each word they have to a blob (using a code I found in CryptoJS's issues in Google Code, mentioned below) and I guess here is what goes wrong. I also generated a map for where encrypted chunks end so I can later use it to get the chunks out of the binary file for decryption.
And here's how I decrypt the files:
function decryptFile (file, sigBytesMap, filename, options, resolve, reject) {
  if (!options.decrypt) {
    return resolve(file)
  }
  if (!options.processor || !options.context) {
    return reject('No decryption method.')
  }

  function decryptBlob (file, index, start, stop) {
    const blob = file.slice(start, stop)
    const fileReader = new FileReader()

    fileReader.onloadend = function () {
      if (this.readyState !== FileReader.DONE) return

      const result = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(this.result)
      decryptedFile[index] = decrypt(result)

      chunksResolved++
      if (chunksResolved === count) {
        const {sigBytes, words} = getCipherInfo(decryptedFile)
        const finalFile = getBlob(sigBytes, words)

        resolve(finalFile, filename)
      }
    }
    fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob)
  }

  let chunksResolved = 0
  const count = sigBytesMap.length
  const decryptedFile = []
  const decrypt = value => options.processor.call(
    options.context, value, 'file',
    (v, k) => CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(v, k))

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    decryptBlob(file, i, parseInt(sigBytesMap[i - 1]) || 0, parseInt(sigBytesMap[i]) - 1)
  }
}

Decryption is exactly like the encryption but doesn't work. Although chunks are not 1MB anymore, they are limited to sigBytes mentioned in the map. There is no result for the decryption! sigBytes: 0.
Here's the code for generating a blob and getting sigbytesMap:
function getCipherInfo (ciphers) {
  const sigBytesMap = []
  const sigBytes = ciphers.reduce((tmp, cipher) => {
    tmp += cipher.sigBytes || cipher.ciphertext.sigBytes
    sigBytesMap.push(tmp)
    return tmp
  }, 0)

  const words = ciphers.reduce((tmp, cipher) => {
    return tmp.concat(cipher.words || cipher.ciphertext.words)
  }, [])

  return {sigBytes, sigBytesMap, words}
}

function getBlob (sigBytes, words) {
  const bytes = new Uint8Array(sigBytes)
  for (var i = 0; i < sigBytes; i++) {
    const byte = (words[i >>> 2] >>> (24 - (i % 4) * 8)) & 0xff
    bytes[i] = byte
  }

  return new Blob([ new Uint8Array(bytes) ])
}

I'm guessing the issue is the method I'm using to read the encrypted chunks. Or maybe writing them!
I should also mention that previously I was doing something different for encryption. I was stringifying each WordArray I got as the result for CryptoJS.AES.encrypt using the toString method with the default encoding (which I believe is CryptoJS.enc.Hex) but some files didn't decrypt correctly. It didn't have anything to do with the size of the original file, rather than their types. Again, I'm guessing!
","Turns out the problem was the WordArray returned by CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(value, key) has 4 extra words as padding which should not be included in the final result. CryptoJS tries unpadding the result but only changes sigBytes accordingly and doesn't change words. So when decrypting, before writing chunks to file pop those extra words. 4 words for full chunks and 3 for smaller ones (last chunk).

","You have new RijndaelEngine(256) in your Android code. It is Rijndael with a block size of 256. CryptoJS only supports AES which is Rijndael with a block size of 128.
Since CryptoJS only supports AES with a block size of 128, the IV size also must be 128. You should parse the IV as Hex. CryptoJS doesn't seem to mind that a bigger IV is passed. In CryptoJS:
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('1ec9b4a4767e582b8a1e3dcad1782f80');

And in Android you can use the Hex class that you already have in your code.
If you don't want to change the JavaScript code, you can use only the first 128-bit of the IV in Android (I suspect this is what CryptoJS does, but couldn't verify it):
byte[] iv = Arrays.copyOf(IV.getBytes(""UTF-8""), 16);

","This makes sense, most of the time you'll get an error if the bytes don't fit neatly into CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.  But on occasion, like you said the user might get lucky (or unlucky) and submit a key that decrypts to valid Utf8 bytes and it doesn't really know the difference.  I'd be curious to know how often this happens.
My solution would be to parse the decrypted string and look for a few 'indicators' that the message looks like a normal English sentence, instead of a random string of random characters.  First thing I would do would be to check for the number of spaces in the string.  This would probably be the single best indicator.

","I'm not a security expert. You might consider asking a question on Information Security for a better opinion (read their FAQ first), but:
1) You shouldn't be trying to decrypt a message with the wrong key in the first place. That's just not something that should be happening. If a message is intended for a particular user and was encrypted using their key then include in your message who it's for and on the receiving end check if the message was for you:
Sending:
var message = { user: 1122, body: encryptedMessage };
send(message);

Recieving:
if (message.user == myUserId) {
    decyptMessage(message.body);
} else {
    // this message isn't for you
}

2) If for some reason that doesn't work, then you would need to insert something in the message that you can use to confirm that it's decypted properly. A checksum would achieve this:
Sending:
var message = originalMessage + CalcChecksum(originalMessage);
send(encypt(message));

Recieving:
var decrypted = decrypt(message);
var msg = getTheBodyPartOfTheMessage(decrypted);
var chk = getTheChecksumPartOfTheMessage(decrypted);
if (chk == CalcChecksum(msg) {
    // this is a good message
} else {
    // this message isn't for you
}

You can used a fixed length checksum so that, say, the last two characters are always the checksum or you could use some character (that won't otherwise appear) as a delimiter.
I like the checksum better than the idea of prefixing (or postfixing) some known string to every message because the checksum will be different for each message (well, not quite - but you won't be able to predict it).

","Put a prefix at the beginning of each message, e.g.
encrypt(""ABCD"" + message);

Then when you decrypt, check if the result begins with ""ABCD"".
This isn't foolproof, since it's possible that an incorrect decryption could have the same prefix, but it's very unlikely (make it longer to reduce the chance).
However, there's a security implication, since if someone knows that every message begins with the same prefix, it can help them analyze and try to break the encryption (similar to how you can use known letter frequencies when trying to break a simple Caesar cypher).
A slightly better method would be to generate a random string, and then put it in two places in the string before encrypting. Then check that they match.
random = random_string(10);
encrypt(random + message + random);

Then after decrypting, check if the first and last 10 characters match.

Essentially HMAC the encrypted data with the encryption key and append the result to the encrypted data.
Prior to decryption HMAC the encrypted data with the decryption key and compare to the appended HMAC value. (Use a constant time comparison function.)

If your server was ""dynamically"" serving the JavaScript then it could insert a ""secret"" based on the clients current session/login. Assuming you are using HTTPS (if not there could be a man in the middle slurping up the ""secret"") then it's not unreasonable to assume that communication to the server signed with that specific ""secret"" (even over unsecured HTTP) belongs to only that client.

How can this be secure considering that the secret key must be stored in plain sight in the JavaScript source deployed on the client ?

Each client should get their own key/secret which enables them access to the resources they are supposed to have access to.  This is effectively no different than a user knowing their own username and password.  Their user/pass combo only allows access to the resources they need.  The same should go for the key pair.

Anyone can take the key and issue similar requests to the server under the identity of the original client of the API. Isn't ""identity"" the problem that HMAC is supposed to solve ?

Yes, of course if someone gets your key and secret they can issue requests as if they came from you.  Simply don't give out your secret to others.  Having it in JavaScript doesn't matter at all.  Sure, the user can see it but unless they take that key and secret and put it somewhere else, it isn't a problem.
I have a system where a user logs in through normal means (username/password, OAuth, OpenID, etc.) and is immediately issued a key/secret for making API calls.  The client-side application uses this key/secret to actually do its work.  The issuance of this key/secret is done over HTTPS.  I wanted to use HMAC for my API since I wanted the user to be able to pre-sign requests to be used in the open.  This method enables me to keep HMAC for the usual administrative GUI as well.

While doing debuging on javascript side i am still getting base64string after encryption but c# encryption base64string and javascript
encryption base64string looks different. For that reason webservice doesn't succefully return the data.
I wonder aes plugin i were using is not doing exactly what they are doing in c# side.
Anybody have any idea why? Any help would be a great input.
","I see quite a few significant difference between how the two compute a key. In the JS, you're hashing a password key, then representing that hash's binary data as base64. Whereas in your C# code, it looks like you're representing the hash's binary data base base64, then taking a substring of that base64 string, then getting the UTF8 bytes of the base64 characters. Those are some really significant differences. The JS side can be simplified a bit, and the C# side can be simplified a lot. On both sides, take the hash of the password key, and use that hash itself as the key. Don't convert the hash to base64. Don't do any other manipulations.
** It would actually be better to use something like PBKDF2, but let's get both sides in sync first.
** Actually since the data is being sent through ajax, if you can use HTTPS, that would be the best option.

JS encryption code:
let pub = ""-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"";

//I have a function that just creates a random string of characters
let key = generateKey(32);
let aesData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt( ""test"", key );
let symKey = aesData.key + "":::"" + aesData.iv;
let msg = aesData.toString();

let rsa = new JSEncrypt();
rsa.setPublicKey( pub );
let cryptKey = rsa.encrypt( symKey );

//I'm passing the data through a hidden form field
$(""#key"").val(cryptKey + "":::"" + msg);

PHP decryption code:
$key = openssl_get_privatekey( file_get_contents( $_SERVER[""PRIV_KEY""]) );
$encryptedKey = explode( "":::"", $msg )[0];
$realMsg = base64_decode(explode( "":::"", $msg )[1]);

openssl_open($realMsg, $decrypted, $encryptedKey, $key);
return $decrypted;

The code above outputs nothing because the openssl_open call fails (returns false). When I base 64 decode the $encryptedKey variable, I get:
�vEi���pΕ��d_���@����욲JE��

but the symmetric key changes every time, so the output changes every time as well. Like I said, I've tried different encoding combinations, but they all return similar nonsense. As the JS code shows, I've encrypted the message ""test"".
I've never implemented encryption before, so I might be way off the mark here, but after staring at this code for days, any insight would be appreciated.
Edit: I'm having problems decrypting with my private key in PHP, not with the symmetric key
","Figured it out!!! So, I found out that PHP has a function to decrypt without needing an envelope called openssl_private_decrypt that uses a private key to decrypt a message. By using that function and base 64 decoding the encrypted key, I am able to decrypt the symmetric key on the server side and will hopefully be able to decrypt the message symmetrically now. For those interested, my code on the server side is:
$key = openssl_get_privatekey( file_get_contents( $_SERVER['PRIV_KEY'] ) );
$encryptedKey = base64_decode(explode( "":::"", $msg )[0]);

if( openssl_private_decrypt($encryptedKey, $decrypted, $key) )
{
    return $decrypted;
}
return $encryptedKey;

And on the client side, my code is the same as it was above. Hope this helps someone!

for this example to work correctly.
The key you used is not a hex string but a text string. Your online example is no longer valid but I figured it out after a couple of tries.
If change the following line:
var _key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key);

to:
var _key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(key);

Your code example will work fine with your original data string.
When you decrypted the text on http://aes.online-domain-tools.com/ you probably had the plaintext textbox selected instead of hex for your key input.

My CryptoJS encryption code:
password = document.getElementById(""usrp"").value;
password = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(password, <?php echo '""'.$_SESSION['adk'].'""'; ?>);

","IV
You're using the CBC mode of operation which requires an IV. If you use a static IV for all your ciphertexts then you miss out on an important property of encryption which is semantic security. If you use the same IV, attackers may observe your ciphertext and determine whether you sent the same plaintext with the same key, because the ciphertext will be the same.
To prevent that, you can generate a random IV for each encryption you do. The IV doesn't have to be secret, but it has to be unpredictable. Since it doesn't have to be secret, you can simply prepend it to the ciphertext and slice it off before decryption or send it otherwise in a structured fashion. You need to use IV during decryption. Otherwise, the first block will be different from the original plaintext.
Keep in mind that CryptoJS' WordArray.random() uses Math.random() internally which is not cryptographically secure. It would be better to use a better randomness source. You can use this drop in replacement from my project of that function for semi-modern browsers which uses the WebCrypto API:
(function(C){
    var WordArray = C.lib.WordArray;
    var crypto = window.crypto;
    var TypedArray = Int32Array;
    if (TypedArray && crypto && crypto.getRandomValues) {
        WordArray.random = function(nBytes){
            var array = new TypedArray(Math.ceil(nBytes / 4));
            crypto.getRandomValues(array);
            return new WordArray.init(
                    [].map.call(array, function(word){
                        return word
                    }),
                    nBytes
            );
        };
    } else {
        console.log(""No cryptographically secure randomness source available"");
    }
})(CryptoJS);

and use it like this:
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

Key
The key is trickier, because it needs to be kept confidential. The basic way is:
Let the user type in the password that is also present on the server and derive the key from the password by for example using PBKDF2 which CryptoJS also provides. Perfectly secure as long as you use TLS and the developers don't change the code.

To solve this I had to, in the frontend, encrypt the data, manually create an object and assign the encrypted information. And then in the backend access the payload's key of the object.
In code:
The frontend is like so:
let encryptedData = {};
if (process.env.REACT_APP_ENCRYPT) {
  encryptedData.data = Crypt.encrypt(JSON.stringify(requestBody))
}

and then in the backend (inside authSignInWeb()) do:

","https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#The_Hasher_Input

The hash algorithms accept either strings or instances of CryptoJS.lib.WordArray [...] an array of 32-bit words. When you pass a string, it's automatically converted to a WordArray encoded as UTF-8.

So, when you pass a string (and don't use CryptoJS.enc.* to generate a WordArray) it automatically converts the string (message) to a utf8 WordArray.
See here for sample roundtrip encrypt/decrypt:
https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#The_Cipher_Output
Here's a jsfiddle to play with CryptoJS
https://jsfiddle.net/8qbf4746/4/
var message = ""café"";
var key = ""something"";

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, key);
//equivalent to CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(message), key);
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key);

$('#1').text(""Encrypted: ""+encrypted);
$('#2').text(""Decrypted: ""+decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

To emphasize my point here is the same thing using Latin1 encoding:
https://jsfiddle.net/3a8tf48f/2/
var message = ""café"";
var key = ""something"";

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(message), key);
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key);

$('#1').text(""Encrypted: "" + encrypted);
$('#2').text(""Decrypted: "" + decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1));

On a side note, the API would probably be better if it only accepted WordArray and didn't overload the toString method (which is just a convenience interface to CryptoJS.enc.*.stringify).  The string conversion magic is a little misleading.

String Test = ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ..."";
String password = ""test"";

KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance(""AES"");
SecureRandom sr = SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG"");
sr.setSeed(password.getBytes(""UTF8""));
kgen.init(256, sr);
SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();

Output example:
encryptString: 2NVoJzMkPphwUJc2h/4LfsmAwyJlejbWKGLG2ACNbaI=
encryptString iv: YX5SF+cFwzv1I4OiGrJk3A==

When I move over to the JavaScript side I first convert the base64 encoding to bytes. Then I run it through the CryptoJS AES Decrypt function.
var decrypt = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""2NVoJzMkPphwUJc2h/4LfsmAwyJlejbWKGLG2ACNbaI="");
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""YX5SF+cFwzv1I4OiGrJk3A=="");
var password = ""test"";

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(decrypt.toString(), password, {
    iv: iv,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
});

Output is always empty. Is there something else I am missing on Android that I also need to pass to CryptoJS?
","Found the problem and it was not an padding issue. 
As other people have stated it have to do with the fact I was using SecureRandom.getInstance(""SHA1PRNG""). 
I corrected the problem in my code was generating a key with PBEKeySpec on Android and PBKDF2 on CryptoJS. Then just following the same steps:
String Test = ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ..."";
String password = ""test"";

byte[] salt = new String(""12345678"").getBytes(""Utf8"");
int iterationCount = 2048;
int keyStrength = 256;

SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, iterationCount, keyStrength);
SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);

Log.d(""encryptString Key: "", new String(Base64.encodeBase64(tmp.getEncoded())));

Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");
c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, tmp);
byte[] decrypted = c.doFinal(Test.getBytes());
decrypted = Base64.encodeBase64(decrypted);
byte[] iv = c.getIV();

Log.d(""encryptString: "", new String(decrypted));
Log.d(""encryptString iv:"", new String(Base64.encodeBase64(iv)));

Example output from run code on Android:
encryptString Key:: ueTU6u4PXbm86zy+UtlQfeh55xZorA58W3fKKBypheM=
encryptString:: ii8UNoi4xG1zGC8RyzHKu6JMkxixkK7LTPxGMaCHGNk=
encryptString iv:: nwy2VHctPnXOd/rahPFiWg==

Now we generate the same PBKDF2 key in a JavaScript and input the output above into our sample code below:


var salt = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""12345678"");
var password = ""test"";
var keyBits = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(password, salt, {
  hasher: CryptoJS.algo.SHA1,
  keySize: 8,
  iterations: 2048
});

var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""nwy2VHctPnXOd/rahPFiWg=="");
var message = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""ii8UNoi4xG1zGC8RyzHKu6JMkxixkK7LTPxGMaCHGNk="");

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(""ii8UNoi4xG1zGC8RyzHKu6JMkxixkK7LTPxGMaCHGNk="", keyBits, {
  iv: iv,
  padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7,
  mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC
});

console.log(encrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

So I need algorithm equivalent to ""RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding"" or how to achieve the same in node.js
","Firstly, you shouldn't use ""ECB"" mode cipher, because:

ECB is a block cipher mode, RSA isn't an algorithm based on that mode of operation.
If you use an algorithm based on that mode of operation (for example AES), you shouldn't use ECB, because it doesn't have IV (Initialization Vector), so it's insecure and a crypto analyzer could break the cipher. You could use CBC, it has IV, or GCM, if you want to share sensitive information to external systems and prevent Oracle Padding. I recommend you visit the following link:

MSC61-J. Do not use insecure or weak cryptographic algorithms 
So, in this case, you just need to use OAEP for RSA encryption, because it's a padding scheme and it helpts to prevent Oracle Padding for asymetric algorithms, then change your code for: RSA/None/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding. Maybe, you could get compatibility with Node.js. Also, I recommend you visit the official web site:
JCA Reference Guide
I hope this information helps you.

"31841942","Converting a 64 bit number string to word array using CryptoJS","I want to know if a string with integer data can be converted to a CryptoJS word array correctly?
Example. Can I convert ""175950736337895418"" into a word array the same way I can create a word array out of 175950736337895418 (int value). 
I have some code that converts integer values to word array
 // Converts integer to byte array
 function getInt64Bytes( x ){
    var bytes = [];
    for(var i = 7;i>=0;i--){
        bytes[i] = x & 0xff;
        x = x>>8;
    }
    return bytes;
}

//converts the byte array to hex string
function bytesToHexStr(bytes) {
    for (var hex = [], i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {
        hex.push((bytes[i] >>> 4).toString(16));
        hex.push((bytes[i] & 0xF).toString(16));
    }
    return hex.join("""");
}

// Main function to convert integer values to word array
function intToWords(counter){
    var bytes = getInt64Bytes(counter);
    var hexstr = bytesToHexStr(bytes);
    var words = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(hexstr);
    return words;
}

Even this code doesn't work correctly as very large integer numbers (exceeding javascript limit of numbers 2^53 - 1) get rounded off. Hence I wanted a solution that could take the integer value as string and convert it to a word array correctly.
PS. I need this word array to calculate the HMAC value using the following code
CryptoJS.HmacSHA512(intToWords(counter), CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key))

","What you want is to parse big numbers from strings. Since this is necessary for RSA, you can use Tom Wu's JSBN to get that functionality. Be sure to include jsbn.js and jsbn2.js. Then you can use it like this:


function intToWords(num, lengthInBytes) {
    var bigInt = new BigInteger();
    bigInt.fromString(num, 10); // radix is 10
    var hexNum = bigInt.toString(16); // radix is 16
    
    if (lengthInBytes && lengthInBytes * 2 >= hexNum.length) {
        hexNum = Array(lengthInBytes * 2 - hexNum.length + 1).join(""0"") + hexNum;
    }

    return CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(hexNum);
}

var num = ""175950736337895418"";
numWords = intToWords(num);

document.querySelector(""#hexInt"").innerHTML = ""hexNum: "" + numWords.toString();
document.querySelector(""#hexIntShort"").innerHTML = ""hexNumShort: "" + intToWords(""15646513"", 8).toString();

var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""11223344ff"");

document.querySelector(""#result"").innerHTML = ""hexHMAC: "" + 
        CryptoJS.HmacSHA512(numWords, key).toString();

If you need the result in a specific length, then you can pass the number of required bytes as the second argument.

","CryptoJS.AES.decrypt expects either a CipherParams object or an OpenSSL-formatted string. If the passed key is a string then the OpenSSL-formatted string is expected and otherwise the CipherParams object.
Since your key is not a string, you need this:
var decryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({

}, key, {

If the key is a string, then it isn't actually a key, but assumed to be a password and a key will be derived from that password with a random 8 byte salt. This would be comparable to OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey function.

AES - Encryption with Crypto (node-js) / decryption with Pycrypto (python)
Not sure if they have the code similar to the js I have here
""y.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)""

This in python what it means
I have tried something like this from another source
from base64 import b64decode
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

iv = 'random'
key = 'Q05WTmhPSjlXM1BmeFd0UEtiOGg='
encoded = b64decode('some large string')

dec = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)
value = dec.decrypt(encoded)

","There are multiple problems with your CryptoJS code and Python code.
Wrong key size
Your key s contains only 20 bytes (160 bit) which doesn't constitute any of the valid key sizes for AES which are 128 (10), 192 (12) and 256 bit (14 rounds). CryptoJS will silently run the key schedule for a 160 bit key with 11 rounds which PyCrypto doesn't support (see AES.c).
You can reduce the key to 128 bit like this in CryptoJS:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse('Q05WTmhPSjlXM1BmeFd0UEtiOGg=');
key.sigBytes = 16;
key.clamp();

or in Python:
key = b64decode('Q05WTmhPSjlXM1BmeFd0UEtiOGg=')[:16]

Wrong character encoding
You forgot to decode the key from a Base64 string in Python and you forgot to decode the IV from hex. The character '0' and the byte 0x00 are entirely different. There's an easier way to define an all zero IV:
iv = ""\0""*16

No unpadding
CryptoJS uses PKCS#7 padding by default, but PyCrypto doesn't implement any padding and only handles data as a multiple of the block size. After you decrypt something, you need to remove the padding yourself in Python:
value = value[:value[-1]]

(the last byte determines how many bytes are padding bytes). More on that here.

Other considerations:
You really shouldn't be setting the IV to a static value. The IV should be randomly generated for every encryption using the same key. Otherwise, you will lose semantic security. Since the IV doesn't have to be secret, you can put it in front of the ciphertext and slice it off before decryption.

Check out my failed attempt in my jsfiddle or here:

console.log(js_decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));                      // Hello!

Any idea why the decryption fails?
","PHP and Ruby take the key and IV as a binary string. They don't assume that it is Hex-encoded which means that only the first 32 characters of your 64 character key will be used. OpenSSL silently uses only the number of bytes it needs and doesn't throw an error (which it should in this case).
You probably want something like this in CryptoJS:
var key    = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF"");
var iv     = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""1234567890ABCDEF"");

So, although this key has 256 bits in it, the security is actually only 128 bits, because each character has only 4 bit in a Hex-encoded string.

Since I am using the same IV's and key's to encrypt I would expect that this would work decrypt just fine. However I seem to be missing something since I still see gibberish in the plaintext.
EDIT:

Well it seems that the whole purpose of AES is that the keys and
  IV's I must use are output by CryptoJS (see the console.log's in
  the JS function). If I use those the function seems to run just fine.
  But I don't want that actually since those keys are dynamically
  generated thus each time I ran the JS function they change. I just
  need a shared private-key between client and server that is used to
  encrypt/decrypt and is static. As simple as that.

","Your key is 128 bit (the length of $key is 32 hexadecimal characters, which means 16 byte or 128 bit). However, in your mcrypt_decrypt() call you're telling PHP to use MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 with a 256-bit key. Try using MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 instead. Normally ciphers should adapt to the length of the passed key, but it could be that PHP is padding the key with null bytes to use 256-bit encryption.
Secondly, in PHP mcrypt_decrypt is set to use the CBC mode (see MCRYPT_MODE_CBC). You don't specify which mode CryptoJS should use. Luckily for you, according to docs for CryptoJS, the CBC mode is the one used by default; however, since you're writing portable code you should consider making that explicit.
edit
If it tells you that the key is too long, it's because you're not packing them. You're giving PHP an hex-encoded string long 32 bytes (256 bit), which is not your key! To get the binary data you need to do:
$key = pack('H*', ""000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"");
$iv = pack('H*', ""101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f"");

the pack('H*', $str); function converts an hex representation to the binary string.

","MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 is not the same as AES. The 256 relates to the block size of the cipher, not the key size.
Quick history lesson - AES was a competition that was eventually won by an algorithm called Rijndael. Rinjdael is a cipher defined for several block sizes (128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 bits). However, for AES only the 128-bit block size was selected.
The block size defines the size of the IV, when you use a mode that needs an IV (like CBC-mode). So for AES, you'll always need a 128-bit IV, regardless of key size. The supported key sizes are 128, 192 or 256 bits.
In PHP, one can use AES by using the cipher MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128.

I think the problem is the pack() part, which changes the Hex string to binary. Therefore, I found a way to reproduce the pack() function in ASP:
Dim key2, hexarr, binstr
key2 = ""12 34 56 78 90 AB CD EF""
hexarr = Split(key2)
ReDim binarr(UBound(hexarr))

For i = 0 To UBound(hexarr)
  binarr(i) = Chr(CInt(""&h"" & hexarr(i)))
Next

binstr = Join(binarr, """")

How to get the second result in Python,Thanks!
","To get the desired clientKey2 you need to encode the hex digits of your saltedPassword string to bytes. One way to do that which works on both Python 2 & Python 3 is to use binascii.unhexlify.
Your HmacSHA256 function is a bit odd. It won't work on Python 3, since bytes objects don't have an .encode method. In Python 2, bytes is just a synonym for str.
Anyway, here's some code that works on both Python 2 & Python 3.
from __future__ import print_function
import hashlib
import hmac
import binascii

key = ""Client Key"".encode()
salted = ""6e441ccd26e6b35198b4b17457dc0266d36b751d0062b5850b0e302ceb1d6dcc""
raw = binascii.unhexlify(salted)

signature = hmac.new(key, salted.encode(), digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
print(signature)

signature = hmac.new(key, raw, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
print(signature)

output
857ef8988876a3bb6bcadb85ca257787074e73e830d7dc14c1f838ba46aef1f5
9a8574da9b276ee1162dcb92071df587f4513bc03060bda1e9b3897d46233416

The output is identical on Python 2 & Python 3.
BTW, it would be simpler to do this task in Python 3, which makes a clean distinction between text and byte strings. Also, the Python 3 hashlib module has a pbkdf2 function.

Is there any way in which I can modify my components/cipher.js class

  asynchronous.

In node.js, the only way to convert a truly synchronous CPU-bound operation to an asynchronous operation is to either invoke it in another process or write/modify native code that can use native threads/processes and hook that into node.js as a module.
So, if you really want to keep it from blocking the main node.js executino thread, you'd have to move it out of the node.js process.  You could startup a group of child processes (probably making them simple http servers would be simplest) and then use a work queue to queue up info for each crypto process.  Each crypto process would just listen for a request to do some crypto work.  Since the request to that child process would be an http request, it would be asynchronous from the main node.js thread.  You could fire up as many crypto processes as you had CPUs (minus one) in your computer.  Or, yo could even use other computers for the crypto processes (that doesn't really matter since you're talking to them with http requests).
There's nothing that says the other servers have to be web servers.  They could be webSocket servers or you could make your own protocol on top of TCP.  I suggested web servers just because they are so simple (just a couple lines of code in node.js) and they are easy to scale.
One simple idea might be to create a clustered crypto http server.  Then, you could just blindly make requests of it and the nodejs clustering would automatically handle the load balancing and scaling for you.

PHP uses Zero padding (padding of 0-15 bytes of 0x00), but CryptoJS uses PKCS#7 padding by default. Those are incompatible.
CryptoJS' decrypt() function expects a CipherParams object which you can simply emulate by passing an object with the ciphertext property set.

Together:
iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(iv);
ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(ciphertext);

var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({ ciphertext: ciphertext }, crypto_key, {
    iv: iv,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.ZeroPadding
});
console.log(decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

Don't forget to include pad-zeropadding-min.js.

Keep in mind that JavaScript cryptography has its problems for justification. You really should be using SSL, because without SSL, this is just obfuscation (key is sent along with the ciphertext).
It would be better to do the PKCS#7 padding in PHP and keep the default in CryptoJS.

Simple string parsing clears the encrypted string and gives me the following data:
let iv = ""d6d6bd8ee407bc25a7b23d8d36b7bce9"" 
let salt = ""b8e72892c801c87c""

and a key formend with other data
let key = ""8aa1ec1e6948b481d1ee450c94ffb2edc774877325df4d05aca2e5827497ed33""

Here is the peace of code I use to decrypt response:
// transforming key to [UInt8]
    let keyChars = Array(key.characters)
    let keyBytes = 0.stride(to: keyChars.count, by: 2).map {
        UInt8(String(keyChars[$0 ..< $0+2]), radix: 16) ?? 0
    }

    // transforming iv to [UInt8]
    let ivChars = Array(iv.characters)
    let ivBytes = 0.stride(to: ivChars.count, by: 2).map {
        UInt8(String(ivChars[$0 ..< $0+2]), radix: 16) ?? 0
    }

    // transforming encryptedData to [UInt8]
    let messageData = encrypted.dataFromHexadecimalString()
    let byteArray = messageData!.arrayOfBytes()


    do {
        let decryptedBytes: [UInt8] = try AES(key: keyBytes, iv: ivBytes, blockMode: .CFB).decrypt(byteArray)
        let data = NSData.withBytes(decryptedBytes)
        let decrypted = data.base64EncodedStringWithOptions([])
        let json = try NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions())
        print(""decrypted = \(json)"")
    } catch {
        print(""error = \(error)"")
    }

What ever I do I get either error = Decrypt or base64 string that does not decode to a JSON as it suppose to.
P.S.: I did try CryptoJS.swift but the result was ""undefined""
UPD
Sample project
This is how data encrypted on back end:
CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(options.params), key, { format: JsonFormatter }).toString()

This is how data decrypted on back end:
JSON.parse(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(raw, key, { format: JsonFormatter })))

I tried to to something similar in my sample project but for some reason it did not work for me.
UPD2
Update from back end
// Nodejs import
var node_cryptojs   = require('node-cryptojs-aes');
var CryptoJS        = node_cryptojs.CryptoJS;
var JsonFormatter   = node_cryptojs.JsonFormatter;
// Data to encrypt and encryption key
var data            = {'hello':'world'};
var key             = '8aa1ec1e6948b481d1ee450c94ffb2edc774877325df4d05aca2e5827497ed33';
// Encryption of the data
var encrypted       = CryptoJS.AES.encry

var decrypted       = JSON.parse(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key, { format: JsonFormatter })))

UPD3
No, the name is similar but the API is different. We used npmjs.com/package/node-cryptojs-aes on the server-side (encryption+ decryption) and code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js client-side on our site (also encryption+decryption)

I have CryptoJS for my client side and ASP.Net (VB.Net) for my server side. The server side is being used in numerous places so cannot change so the CryptoJS needs work around what the .NET is doing. I can't get my CryptoJS to imitate the .NET 100%. 
FYI the .NET code can't change, the JS has to match .NET functionality.

The error I get in .NET when I try and decrypt the client side encryption:

Padding is invalid and cannot be removed.

Extra Information
If I just push through a Hex as the key (remove the .toString(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1)), I don't get enough characters (seems to change to 128bit instead of 256bit).
The actual data returned by MD5_Key in JS seems to match Validate_MD5 in .NET...
Am I trying to achieve the impossible?
","CryptoJS supports only AES which is basically Rijndael but limited to the block size of 128-bit. It supports key sizes of 128, 192 and 256-bit. You .net code uses Rijndael with a block size of 256 which is not supported by CryptoJS. CryptoJS happily takes the big IV and only uses the first 16 bytes.
You will have to find another library that supports this since you can't change the .net code.

Output from CryptoJS:

The base64 string encrypted has same length but not the hex.
If I put the output result of CryptoJS in Java Code, the decryption is incorrect.
Regards,
","One problem here is that you're using 64 bit keys and iv's. 
CryptoJS supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, and AFAIK Java supports AES-128, so you should probably be specifying 128 bit keys and IVs. That might be the whole problem - I'm sure using the wrong key size is undefined behavior.
As for the difference in output lengths, 22 base64 characters is 132 bits of information, so it's a 128 bit answer (There isn't a unique 128 bit length, 21 characters would have been too few).  CryptoJS is outputting 32 hex characters, which is 128 bits of information. This seems correct.
The Java code is outputting 48 hex characters which is 192 bits of information. So it's the java code that's wrong. I'm not sure why it's outputting more, though.

","Solving it is pretty simple, but reading the docs and the code, I'm not quite clear why.
This is clearly wrong:
let msg1 = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(text, CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key), { mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding});

Given your description, you are expecting the byte sequence represented by the hex digits ""8bf3955488af91feb7bd87220910cee0"" to be the body. But that's not what your passing. You're passing the characters. So when it decrypts it, the first byte is the ASCII value of 8 (0x38), not 0x8b. Given that, you should be parsing the hex like this:
let msg1 = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(text), ...

But, for reasons I'm having trouble understanding, that doesn't work. decrypt expects Base64 (or at least it will accept Base64). I can't find any documentation that says this, and the code creates the decrypt function magically in a way that I don't fully understand, and this is why I really hate doing crypto work in JavaScript.
That's out of my system now, so let's get to the answer:
cipher = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(text))

let msg1 = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipher, CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key), { mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding});

And that should give you the result you're expecting.

As you can see in the snippet it correctly alerts you the encoded message, but it does not change the value of #encodedText. Why might this be so?
LIVE DEMO: redacted.ga/advance.html
","After checking I found that CryptoJS.AES.encrypt() function returns the object and not the string. Hence $.html() doesn't work. So to make it work you have to call it as $(""#encodedText"").html(text.toString()); OR you can call like $(""#encodedText"").text(text);. The later one implicitly converts the object to string before assigning it to DOM.

LIVE DEMO: redacted.ga/advance.html
","Because CryptoJS.AES.encrypt does not return a string with HTML but an object, as you can see if you use the browser console:
console.log(text);


Object { $super={...},  ciphertext={...},  key={...},  más...}

The object has a properly defined toString() method:
console.log(text.toString());


U2FsdGVkX1+r/YSe+2AafmlH+fLkrfUoioilEJ3qay0=

... so it's very easy to get a plain text representation of the hash and you don't need to deal with raw binary output. But you still need to manipulate it as what it is, plain text:
$(""#encodedText"").text(text);

In java server encrypted text using triple des(mode:CFB8, padding:NoPadding)
For decrypt, I tried encrypting such as java server
Below is posted the java source code.  
private final static String keyString = ""123456789012345678901234"";
private final static String ivString = ""abcdefgh"";


public static String encrypt(String data) throws Exception {


    KeySpec keySpec = new DESedeKeySpec(keyString.getBytes());
    SecretKey key = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""DESede"").generateSecret(keySpec);
    IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(ivString.getBytes());
    Cipher ecipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/CFB8/NoPadding"");
    ecipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, iv);

    byte[] valeur = data.getBytes(""UTF-8"");
    byte[] enc = ecipher.doFinal(valeur);

    return new String(Base64.encode(enc, Base64.DEFAULT), ""UTF-8"");
}

And below code is my code.
var key=""123456789012345678901234"";

    iv:iv1,

But I can't get the same result of both.
When I changed ""CFB8"" to ""CFB"" in the Java code, I get the same result.
How can implement the CFB8 in CryptoJS?
","CFB is mode of operation with a shift register. The encryption and decryption happens in segments which have the same size as the shift register and are smaller than the block size.
The problem is that CryptoJS' CFB implementation only supports segment sizes exactly the same as the block size of the used block cipher. This means that when you use AES it will be a segment size of 128-bit.
I've implemented a variable segment size version of CFB which supports all segment sizes that are a power of 2 including 1-bit up to the block size:
/**
 * Cipher Feedback block mode with segment size parameter according to
 * http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38a/sp800-38a.pdf. 
 * The segment size can be anything from 1 bit up to the block size of the 
 * underlying block cipher.
 * 
 * Current limitation: only segment sizes that divide the block size evenly 
 * are supported.

You should use an appropriate padding. CryptoJS uses PKCS#7 padding by default. The best padding for CFB8 would be no padding at all (which you already use).
Example:
var iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);
var encrypted = CryptoJS.TripleDES.encrypt(""message"", key, {
    iv: iv, 
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFBb, 
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding,
    segmentSize: 8
});
var recoveredPlaintext = CryptoJS.TripleDES.decrypt(encrypted, key, {
    iv: iv,
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFBb,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding,
    segmentSize: 8
});
console.log(recoveredPlaintext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

Since this is using a random IV, the only way to see whether the Java and JavaScript implementations are compatible, is to encrypt in one and decrypt in the other in both directions.
Keep in mind that since the IV is random, you need to send it along with the ciphertext. Since it doesn't need to be secret, you can easily prepend it to the ciphertext and slice it off before decryption.

","CryptoJS' encrypt function with a password uses the same EVP_BytesToKey function node.js' createCipher, with the important difference that CryptoJS uses a random salt to derive whereas node does not (emphasis mine):

Note: createCipher derives keys with the OpenSSL function EVP_BytesToKey with the digest algorithm set to MD5, one iteration, and no salt.

Either you directly use CryptoJS in node which is possible, because CryptoJS doesn't have any dependencies, or you do the key derivation yourself on both ends and use crypto.createCipheriv. If you do the former, you would have to additionally pass the salts of the username and password encryptions to node. 
Note that data.username is the CryptoJS cipherParams object which contains the salt and the IV, but when you convert this to string with data.username.toString(), the salt is not included anymore, but the IV is. This is not the data that you would put into the node.js functions. Send data.username.ciphertext instead.

The IV is presumably all 0x00 bytes.
THis indicates one is using ECB m ode and the other is using CBC mode.
See Block cipher mode of operation, specifically ECB and CBC modes.
ECB mode encrypted each block independly, CBC mode xors the previous block with the data to be encrypted and for the first block the IV. Since the IV is all 0x00 values no change is made to the first block.
Options can be specified in the createion of the encryptor, you need to see the documentation page, good luck with that.
It would look something like:

Thanks in advance.
","AES is a block cipher and requires input in block size chunks, 16-bytes for AES. If the data to be encrypted is not an even multiple of the block size padding bytes need to be added. PKCS#7 padding is a common padding mode. Most AES libraries support a PKCS#7 padding mode which will add padding on encryption and remove the padding on decryption.
In this case 8-bytes of paddig was added and that is eight bytes of the value 0x08.
See PKCS#7 padding.

Note: Do not use ECB mode, it is insecure, see ECB mode, scroll down to the Penguin. Instead use CBC mode with a random IV, just prefix the encrypted data with the IV for use in decryption.

You can see both results here: https://jsfiddle.net/hn5qqLo7/

","In (1) of your fiddle the CryptoJS calculates the SHA1 value of the string, and then, converts the raw bytes to Base64.

","You are using two different systems which may have different defaults.  Do not rely on defaults, but explicitly specify everything to be the same on both sides.  Crypto is designed to fail if even the smallest thing does not match.  You will need to specify the character to byte mapping used, the crypto mode, the IV (if needed), the key and the padding method.
Your different outputs are different lengths, so initially I suspect that padding is the first thing to look at.  Set both sides to PKCS#7 padding and see if that helps.
For further diagnosis, check that the key and IV are byte-for-byte the same on each side.

","All parameters must be specified and correct. Do not rely on defaults, they are implementation dependent and will very between implementations.
In general you should use:  

CBC mode with a random iv, on encryption create a random iv, prepend it to the encrypted data for use on decryption. For AES the iv should be 16-bytes, the block size. Do not use ECB mode, it is insecure, see ECB mode, scroll down to the Penguin.
PKCS#7 padding (sometimes called PKCS#5). This is needed because AES is a block cipher and input and output must be an exact multiple of the block size. This padding will be automatically added during encryption and removed during decryption.
Ensure the iv and key are exactly the correct size.
For debugging display all inputs and outputs in hexadecimal. It can be helpful during debugging to dump all inputs and outputs just prior to and after encryption and decryption. Hexadecimal allows one to see each byte, Base64 combines 3 bytes into 4 bytes and makes it harder to understand.

When all this is exactly the same the outputs will also be exactly the same.

"52523776","Migrating from 'crypto' to crypto-js library: Binary encoding","I'm trying to generate SHA256 and HmacSHA512 hashes on a device which unfortunately has no support for the standard Node crypto library. So I am adjusting the code to use CryptoJS instead. However, CryptoJS cannot encode the Hash as in binary (only Hex, Base64 and Latin1 are available encoders).
Below is the function I'm trying to migrate. Previous (unusable) code is commented out.
const getMessageSignature = (path, request, secret, nonce) => {
    // Expected outcome:
    // API-Sign = Message signature using HMAC-SHA512 of (URI path + SHA256(nonce + POST data)) and base64 decoded secret API key
    const message = JSON.stringify(request);

    const secret_buffer = btoa(secret);
    const hash = CryptoJS.algo.SHA256.create();
    const hmac = CryptoJS.algo.HMAC.create(CryptoJS.algo.SHA256, secret_buffer);
    const hash_digest = hash.update(nonce + message).finalize().toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
    const hmac_digest = hmac.update(path + hash_digest).finalize().toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

    // CANNOT USE BELOW (Buffer and crypto not supported)
    // const secret_buffer = new Buffer(secret, 'base64');
    // const hash = new crypto.createHash('sha256');
    // const hmac = new crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret_buffer);
    // const hash_digest = hash.update(nonce + message).digest('binary');
    // const hmac_digest = hmac.update(path + hash_digest, 'binary').digest('base64');

    return hmac_digest;
};

","I found the answer. First of all: btoa() is not necessary, as CryptoJS has its own functionality to turn Base64 into its own format (WordLists): CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse. Next up is that path and hash_digest cannot be merged properly as there's a Type Mismatch (string and binary), so JS uses the string representation. The solution is to first create a SHA512 HMAC using CryptoJS.algo.HMAC.create(CryptoJS.algo.SHA512, secret) and then update it step-by-step for each value with hmac.update(value, secret). Finally, you'll also have to use CryptoJS' built-in Base64 decoder to finally produce the signature string.
const getMessageSignature = (path, request, secret, nonce) => {
    // API-Sign = Message signature using HMAC-SHA512 of (URI path + SHA256(nonce + POST data)) and base64 decoded secret API key
    const message = JSON.stringify(request);
    const hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(nonce + message);
    const secret_buffer = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(secret);
    const hmac = CryptoJS.algo.HMAC.create(CryptoJS.algo.SHA512, secret_buffer);
    hmac.update(path, secret_buffer);
    hmac.update(hash, secret_buffer);
    return hmac.finalize().toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);

"43636332","Will this CryptoJS AES encryption code produce secure output?","I believe that because the key passed to AES.encrypt is a string, the function will automatically generate an IV. So is the code below producing a well secured encrypted version of string_to_encrypt?
pass  = document.getElementById('pass').value; // user entered pwrd    salt  = 'some system determined salt';
its   = 9000 + getKeyIterationModifier(pass); // iterations depend on pass
key   = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(pass, salt, { keySize: 512/32, iterations: its });

encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(string_to_encrypt, key.toString());

Or should I be adding 'mode' and 'padding' values to harden it further? If so, what are the current industry standard values?
In other words, should I ideally be using something like the following (perhaps without the iv if that's done automatically) and if so what's ideal:
key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key);
encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(string_to_encrypt, key, {
    iv: iv, 
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, 
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
});

","CryptoJS.AES.encrypt uses EVP_BytesToKey to expand the passed ""key"" (considered a password) to an actual AES-256 key and IV if the ""key"" was a string. It uses a random salt for that, so the ciphertext is randomized. In your second snippet, you need to handle the IV yourself.
What you're essentially asking is whether EVP_BytesToKey is a secure password expansion function. That's not something that can be easily answered. The fact that it uses MD5 means that the first snippet has at least the security of AES-128 which should be good.
The other issue is that the IV should be unpredictable (read: random) for absolutely every encryption. Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. This suggestion is a given in the first snippet, but you would have to work for that realization in the second snippet which might introduce other issues.
If you're not comfortable with CryptoJS and cryptography, go with the first snippet. Otherwise, try to improve the second snippet.

Security considerations:
If you're using only symmetric encryption in the browser you need the exact same key at the server and the client. If you send the encryption key from the server to the client or the other way around you need to encrypt your symmetric encryption key. The easiest way to do this would be to use TLS. If you use TLS, then the data as well as key are encrypted, so you don't need to encrypt it yourself. This doesn't provide any security, just a little bit of obfuscation. You should read: https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/
You should think about integrating authenticated encryption through an authenticated mode like GCM or EAX, or through the use of an encrypt-then-MAC scheme with a strong MAC like HMAC-SHA256.

","There are pros and cons. Mostly pros.

A local file will load faster - disk latency is lower than network latency.
A local file will ensure your extension works offline / in poor connectivity.
A local file is more reliable in case CDN has problems.
A local file enjoys additional protection (at least on Windows/Mac platforms), as CWS will generate checksums for all files and a store-installed extension will be stopped from loading if the files are tampered with.
A local file is safe from network MITM attacks.
A local file is frozen at a particular version - you don't run the risk of a library updating and breaking compatibility.
Using external code in main extension code (not content scripts) requires a modification of CSP and a HTTPS-enabled CDN (for the MITM-attack reason).
Using external code in content scripts may require additional permissions (depending on the CDN's CORS configuration)

However, it will be up to you to keep the library updated.

If there is a critical bug/exploit in the library, a CDN-served file (if it points to ""latest"" version) can be silently updated to mitigate that. In case of a local file, you need to learn about the update and apply it yourself.
A local file cannot be updated without publishing a new version to CWS. An externally-hosted file can be updated independently.

","There are a few issues with your code, the main ones being that you need to supply a key of the right length and you also need to pass a cipherParams object to the decrypt() method rather than the ciphertext itself.
Here's some code that works and, for bonus points, is generally compatibable with the OpenSSL binaries and PHP libraries found on most systems:
var CryptoJS = require( 'crypto-js' );

var secretMessage = 'I hid the chips under the couch.';
var secretKey = 'b52b4f45b6e9337b57869d7cb718c693';

var encryptedMessage = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(secretMessage, CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(secretKey),
                       { mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding });

console.log('encryptedMessage: ' + encryptedMessage.ciphertext);

cipherParams = CryptoJS.lib.CipherParams.create(
               {ciphertext: CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(encryptedMessage.ciphertext.toString())});

var bytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherParams,CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(secretKey),
            { mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB, padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding });

console.log( 'Decrypted:' + bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

There is no Initiatlization Vector because we're using ECB rather than CBC. If you want something secure, use CBC with a random IV for every message.

I can successfully pass the resulting Base64 string to Node.js and have it decode the message. What I also need, is the same encoding method written in Javascript.
Here is what I have so far:
<script src=""http://crypto-js.googlecode.com/svn/tags/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>
...
var text = ""This string is to be encrypted"";
var key = ""12345678901234567890123456789012"";
var iv  = '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00';
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, key, {iv: iv});
console.log(""Base64 encoded: "" + window.btoa(encrypted.ciphertext));

However the resulting Base64 string does not match the one generated by iOS.
Any ideas?
","CryptoJS uses a password-based encryption compatible with OpenSSL when you pass a string as a key. Since you already have a full key and IV, you need to convert them into CryptoJS' native type which is a WordArray:
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""12345678901234567890123456789012"");
var iv  = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create([0, 0, 0, 0]); // each number is a word of 32 bit

By calling btoa() on a WordArray object, you're forcing it to the stringified. The default hex-encoding is used for this. Afterwards btoa() encodes this hex-encoded string into Bas64 which bloats it even more.
You can directly encode a WordArray into Base64:
encrypted.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64)

","First of all even tough your code works fine you wont be able to decrypt it back properly because while you are creating your AES cipher in Java you are using CBC  Cipher and You are implementing a Padding algorithm which is PKCS5Padding.
So your java code does the followings;
When it gets the input it first divide it into the 16 bits blocks then if your input doesnt divide into the 16 overall then the reminders will be padded for filling the block with the same number of reminder.You can see what i mean by the following picture.

So it will do the encryption with the padded ciphers in the java side  but in the Javascript Part You neither declare what type of Mode Aes will use nor declaring the what type of Padding it suppose to do. So you should add those values into the your code.You can make search following code parts. 
                        mode:CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
                        padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7

About the different keys it is occuring because you are sending a Byte[] in to the your Encrypt method then use this unknown Byte[] while you are creating your Key.You didnt mention why your encryption method will be used in your program  but you should create that ""Byte[] key"" same way in the both method.For instance you can refer following code as a example of generating that but it is not secure way of generating keys I just added it for showing you what I mean by you should generate both keys in the same way.

","It seems you have trouble concatenating IV and the ciphertext in CryptoJS. This is rather easy, because CryptoJS' native binary data format (WordArray) supports the concat function:
var ivWords = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(iv); // WordArray instance
var plaintext = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(text); // WordArray instance
var keyWords = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key); // WordArray instance
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, keyWords, { iv: ivWords }); // CipherParams instance

var ct = ivWords.clone().concat(encrypted.ciphertext); // WordArray instance
var ct = ct.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64); // string instance
console.log(ct);



// example data
var iv = ""0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"";
var text = ""text"";
var key = ""1112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f"";

// actual code
var ivWords = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(iv); // WordArray instance
var plaintext = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(text); // WordArray instance
var keyWords = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key); // WordArray instance
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, keyWords, { iv: ivWords }); // CipherParams instance

var ct = ivWords.clone().concat(encrypted.ciphertext); // WordArray instance
var ct = ct.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64); // string instance
output.innerHTML = ct;

<script src=""https://cdn.rawgit.com/CryptoStore/crypto-js/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>

This would produce the same output as 
base64_encode($iv.openssl_encrypt($data, 'aes-256-cbc', $secret, 0, $iv));

as long as iv is actually hex-encoded string with that contains the same bytes as the decoded version in $iv. The same must be true for text (except for the encoding), key and $data, $secret, respectively.

","You could implement a lightweight MAC-ing mechanism  using a Hash Key (known only to you)

Before each call to the webservice feed the first n bytes of your message payload to the hash key and compute a hash value.
Make the call to your webservice, sending the hash value in an http header (I recommend the authorization header, you can create a custom header tho.
In your webservice, before honouring any service request, you verify the authenticity of the message by computing the hashvalue using the same data i.e. the first N bytes and compare with the hash value in the authorization header. Honour the request only if the value checks out.

There is a little processing overhead here and it assumes that the transmission is happening over a secure line, otherwise, the message could still be hijacked. But you solve the problem of bogus calls.

<script type=""text/javascript"">
    var string = ""asdfasdfsadfdsa"";
    var key = ""asdfasfasfs"";
    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(string, key);
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, key);
    alert(decrypted);
</script>


UPDATE!! I can get SHA256 to work just fine with out uses of require.js so I don't thing the problem is Modular include and the lib should be able to run ""without RequireJS"", but I'm still running into encryption and decryption error: ""cfg.hasher is undefined"".
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""CryptoJS/components/core.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""CryptoJS/components/sha256.js""></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    console.log(CryptoJS.SHA256(""Message""));
</script>

","You would have to do modular includes 
Modular include using require js:
require.config({
    packages: [
        {
            name: 'crypto-js',
            location: 'path-to/bower_components/crypto-js',
            main: 'index'
        }
    ]
});

require([""crypto-js/aes"", ""crypto-js/sha256""], function (AES, SHA256) {
    console.log(SHA256(""Message""));
});

","I got the same reject when using PHP call and tried several combination of the rights/IP whitelist when creating the key, no one works. 
However the same code works for the sandbox so I think it might not be a problem in the code, unless, sandbox and live requires different header and that will be quite surprising.

","Go to the Gdax-Node Github repo and take a look at their code and examples.
1) Create an authenticatedClient by configuring it with your api details,
2) Then simply use the authedClient object and calncelAllOrders method: 
authedClient.cancelAllOrders({product_id: 'BTC-USD'}, callback);

You could wrap this with a function to call 'x' amount of times (it states in the documentation), or you cold think of something fancier if you'd like.
Note:- make sure you pull the github repo and do not install from npm directly as there are a few bugs and issues that have been fixed on the git repo but NOT pushed to npm.
...so use npm install coinbase/gdax-node when downloading your gdax package.
Hope that helps a little...

","There's nothing wrong, it's just that the string you got represents an array of bytes (with their hex representation). So all you need to do is Base 64 encode this array of bytes and you will get the exact same result. Checkout it out here, paste your hex represented byte array and base 64 encode it: http://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_base64.php?lang=en
As far as how this can be done, well, you may have a look at this question or this one.

UPDATE:
As pointed out in the comments it seems that there's a built-in way in cryptojs to convert directly to base64:
console.log(signature2.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64));

"16739229","Saving CryptoJS's CryptoMD5 state as a string and restoring it later","I gradually compute the MD5 hash of a large file, during an upload, then at some point I want to save to HTML5 localStorage what I have calculated so far, to be able to resume later.
From what I know, localStorage can store strings, so I have to store the progressive MD5 value as a string and then restore them, when the user opens the browser at a later time.
Basically my code looks like this:
var md5_full = CryptoJS.algo.MD5.create();

var wordArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(chunk);

md5_full.update(wordArray);

At this point, I want to convert md5_full to a string, to be able to save to localStorage. And then, at a later time, when the user wants to resume the upload, to be able to retrieve the md5_full from localStorage, unstringify, and continue to update it with chunks.
In the end I should be able to call md5_full.finalize(); to get the final full MD5 hash digest.
","I think the problem may be with function serialization - CryoJS apparently attempts to serialize functions but it may not restore references correctly (the scope is lost). 
The code below circumvents this problem by restoring only data, not functions. JSFiddle.
(De)serialization functions:
/** Serialize MD5 object. */
function stringify_md5(md5) {
    return JSON.stringify(md5);
}

/** Deserialize MD5 object. */
function parse_md5(serialized_md5) {
    var md5 = CryptoJS.algo.MD5.create();
    restore_data(JSON.parse(serialized_md5), md5);
    return md5;    
}

/** Recursively copy properties from object source to object target. */
function restore_data(source, target) {
    for (var prop in source) {
        var value = source[prop];
        if (typeof value == ""object"") {
            if (typeof target[prop] != ""object"") {
                target[prop] = {};
            }
            restore_data(source[prop], target[prop]);
        } else {
            target[prop] = source[prop];
        }
    }
}

Example of usage:
var chunk1 = ""abc"", chunk2 = ""def"";

// The correct hash:
var md5_full_1 = CryptoJS.algo.MD5.create();
md5_full_1.update(chunk1);
md5_full_1.update(chunk2);
var correct_hash = md5_full_1.finalize();

// Using stringify/parse
var md5_full_2 = CryptoJS.algo.MD5.create();
md5_full_2.update(chunk1);
var md5_serialized = stringify_md5(md5_full_2); // serialize
md5_full_2 = parse_md5(md5_serialized);  // deserialize
md5_full_2.update(chunk2);
var result_hash = md5_full_2.finalize();

alert(correct_hash.toString() == result_hash.toString()); // true

"37729038","Webpack and Loading custom scripts","For the life of me I dont understand how webpack works. Please can somebody help me. Im going to explain with my situation but its actually more of a conceptual question of how to go about using webpack
So im working on an angular 2 project with a webpack starter. I have some js scripts that i got from AWS (my SDK for API-Gateway). Its about 10 js files. Currently i have those 10 files listed in my index.html, and that works great. Obviously this isnt actually great because that means 10 round trips to the server to collect them. So hence my journey into trying to get webpack to include them in a bundle starts
So what i tried to do was to import the files one by one in my main typescript file. The file where my app gets bootstrapped. Just like this for example:
import 'assets/aws-sdk/lib/axios/dist/axios.standalone.js';
import 'assets/aws-sdk/lib/CryptoJS/rollups/hmac-sha256.js';
import 'assets/aws-sdk/lib/CryptoJS/rollups/sha256.js';
...

Is this even remotely the right thing to do. This doesnt work. It complains about CryptoJS not being available in the files that require it. There are some crypto-js files in those that i bring in, and the files that use the variable 'CryptoJS' dont seem to see it.
I found in my webpack config a ProvidePlugin that seems to load jquery like this
new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
  jQuery: 'jquery',
  $: 'jquery',
  /*CryptoJS: 'CryptoJS'*/
}),

So i added Crypto thinking it needs that. Doesnt work. 
My question is this. The js files i need to use internally use a variable called CryptoJS to do things like this:
function hash(value) {
   return CryptoJS.SHA256(value);
}

That works fine including all the scripts in index.html, but how do i get my webpack app to understand what that means. How do i import and bundle these files, and how do i use a varable internal to those files like CryptoJS.
","Okay nevermind after hours of struggling i managed to figure it out. The import i was doing was wrong, to add the js files to the global space (equivalent of adding them to the index.html) is to import them like so
require('script!./assets/aws-sdk/lib/axios/dist/axios.standalone.js');

That script loader does the magic. Youll need that in your project as well can be installed from npm

","It looks like you are base64 encoding the encrypted json string. However you are not base64 decoding it in your PHP example before you attempt to decrypt.
Also if your decrypt function is mcrypt_decrypt then you are passing the parameters wrong, it needs to be mcrypt_decrypt($cipher, $key, $data, $mode, $iv).
Edit: more info
It also appears that you are base64 encoding the other values you pass in your ajax call but don't decode them on php side in your example, will need to do thast as well.

I cannot post it with these signs that's the reason I've made a photo.
","Explanation
Scenario: In JS I encrypt the jsonString with cryptojs. In PHP I decrypt it with ""mcrypt_decrypt"".
But the JsonString which I get in php after the decryption has some funny characters in the end. I can only see these characters if I copy the output of var_dump() and paste it to the IDE (i.e. notepad++, eclipse, etc.).
These characters are always 12. I do not know where they come from (Maybe while the message is encrypted or decrypted), but after ""substring"" them, I can get a valid jsonString for ""json_decode()"".

solution
I just substring the 12 invisible characters after the last curly bracket and it works. I hope it helps someone.


json_decode(substr( $json, 0, strlen( $jsonString)-12));



EDIT Better use this:
$strPad = ord($json[strlen($json)-1]);
$n_data = substr($json, 0, -$strPad); 
$row=json_decode($n_data );

than
json_decode(substr( $json, 0, strlen( $jsonString)-12));

So You don't need to count the points you have to delete like I did.

I'm also use:

            var words = wordArray.words;
            var sigBytes = wordArray.sigBytes;
            var u8 = new Uint8Array(sigBytes);
            for (var i = 0; i < sigBytes; i++) {
                var byte = (words[i >>> 2] >>> (24 - (i % 4) * 8)) & 0xff;
                u8[i]=byte;
            }
            return u8;
        },
        parse: function (u8arr) {
            var len = u8arr.length;
            var words = [];
            for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                words[i >>> 2] |= (u8arr[i] & 0xff) << (24 - (i % 4) * 8);
            }
            return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(words, len);
        }
    };

But when i decrypt the file the results is empty. Ialso check the iv, salt and the encrypted message. All seems work except for the decryption that always returns an empty value.
How can i fix this problem?
Thank you!
","Given it a long try and finally got it. 
1). CryptoJS uses hex values while java uses bytes for the same String.
2.) The two other factors which need to be same (apart from the key) are initVector and padding. 
Considering both above we first have to validate that both Java are CryptoJS and encrypting to the same value given the above parameters are same. 
Here is the code for Java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.math.BigInteger;
import java.util.Base64;

public class JavaEncryptor {

    private static final String key = ""aesEncryptionKey"";
    private static final String initVector = ""encryptionIntVec"";

    public static String toHex(String arg) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
        return String.format(""%020x"", new BigInteger(1, arg.getBytes(""UTF-8"")));
    }


    /**
     * Use these hex value in CryptoJS
     * @throws Exception
     */
    public static void printHexForJS() throws Exception {
        System.out.println(""HexKeyForJS :  ""+ toHex(key));
        System.out.println(""HexInitVectorForJS :  ""+ toHex(initVector));
    }

    public static String encrypt(String value) {
        try {
            IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(initVector.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
            SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(""UTF-8""), ""AES"");


            Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING"");
            cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, iv);

            byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(value.getBytes()); 
            return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encrypted);

        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        printHexForJS();
        System.out.println(encrypt(""MyPlainTextToBeEncrypted""));
    }

}

Output of the above program is 

HexKeyForJS :  616573456e6372797074696f6e4b6579 
  HexInitVectorForJS : 656e6372797074696f6e496e74566563
  MURKOx14eSOo2vs8ZQyCpXpsoKg8Uzlvyj3byQreVBk=

And then for JS encryption use the HexKeyForJS  and HexInitVectorForJS as in below code
var text = ""ManishMudgal"";
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(HexKeyForJS);
var iv  = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(HexInitVectorForJS);

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, key, {iv: iv, padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7});
console.log(encrypted.toString());


Output of the above JS code should be  kBgYcrSxz+kbXRnyKIFmSw==

Which is the same encrypted key generated through Java code 
MURKOx14eSOo2vs8ZQyCpXpsoKg8Uzlvyj3byQreVBk=
Now Decryption at Crypto End
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt('MURKOx14eSOo2vs8ZQyCpXpsoKg8Uzlvyj3byQreVBk=', CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(HexKeyForJS), {iv: CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(HexInitVectorForJS), padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7}).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

"18093316","MS CryptoAPI giving wrong RC4 Results?","I am working on a product that needs to be able to consume files created with an older product. Some of these files contain content encrypted with RC4 encryption using MS CryptoAPI.  I have thus far been unable to successfully decrypt the content using other crypto libraries.  After some experimentation, it appears that CryptoAPI's RC4 output is ""correct"" (i.e. agrees with other libraries) when the key is ASCII, but is ""wrong"" (differs from other libraries that all agree) when the key is not ASCII (e.g. a hash of a password).
Since all the content I'm interested in consuming was encrypted with a key that was derived from a password via hashing, I'm a bit stuck at the moment.  I've written up a small test to show the issue that includes 3 test cases as you can see below in the code.  Botan (C++) and CryptoJS (JS) always agree on output. MS CryptoAPI, however, only agrees for the ASCII keys.
Before I go to MS with this issue, is anyone aware of something I'm misunderstanding or doing wrong that could cause this issue?

","I just wanted to follow up with the answer I found in case this is useful to someone else in the future.
First and foremost, the answer was to RTFM! As it turns out, by default, CryptDeriveKey adds a ""salt"" to 40-bit symmetric keys consisting of all 0's. When I looked at our old CryptoAPI code and saw that we weren't passing any flags into it, I assumed this meant nothing special was going on and I didn't read through the details of all possible flags on MSDN. Furthermore, since MS considers this portion of the key a salt it is not included when you export the key so that was also a dead end.
I eventually found my way to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387695(v=vs.85).aspx which explains the salt mechanism for 40-bit keys and the line that caught my eye was that, for compatibility, you should create keys with the CRYPT_NO_SALT flag.  In our case, we already have encrypted content with such keys, so we simply modified our Botan/CryptoJS code to append 11 bytes of 0s to the end of the base 40-bit key.
The details for the various CryptDeriveKey flags can be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379916(v=vs.85).aspx

PUBLIC ENCRYPT -> PRVATE DECRYPT  is operated well I expected. it always return different result because of padding scheme.
But PRIVATE ENCRYPT -> PUBLIC DECRYPT is always return same message although used padding scheme.
Is there any solution make it different message with Nodejs crypto module???
","This is expected behavior according to the padding schemes for RSA signing and encryption as implemented by OpenSSL, which crypto leverages.
I am not sure what you want to use the functions privateEncrypt() and publicDecrypt() for. If your intent is to sign data, then see my update below. Anyway, for these functions, the crypto documentation explains that it only exposes RSA_PKCS1_PADDING which OpenSSL maps to the deterministic RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 padding scheme under the hood. This means that for the same key and the same data, the resulting data will be the same.
For encryption and decryption, with publicEncrypt() and privateDecrypt(), you have selected the RSA_PKCS1_PADDING mode. This translates to the RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5, a scheme that includes random elements, which cause the different outputs that you observe in your repeated runs. According to the documentation, crypto uses RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING padding by default. This stands for Optimal asymmetric encryption padding, which is non-deterministic as well.
For a summary of the PKCS#1-defined schemes, see PKCS#1 Schemes.

Update: You may want to use the Sign class instead of the privateEncrypt() and publicDecrypt() functions. Its sign() function does support a probabilistic padding mode, which OpenSSL supports via RSASSA-PSS. Using your example code as a starting point, it would look something like this:
const sign = crypto.createSign('SHA256')
sign.update(Buffer.from(originMSG, 'utf8'))
signature = sign.sign({key:PRIVKEY, padding:crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PSS_PADDING}).toString('base64')

The signature will be different every time. Note that you can not ""decrypt"" it, it is a one-way operation. You can only verify it, using the public key with the Verify class:
const verify = crypto.createVerify('SHA256')
verify.update(Buffer.from(originMSG, 'utf8'))
verifyRes = verify.verify({key:PUBKEY, padding:crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PSS_PADDING}, Buffer.from(signature, 'base64'))

More specifically, the value at byte 75 is 5, which is out of the range of characters available to base64. In ascii, it is the ENQ (enquiry) character. As to why this ends up in your final base64 string is beyond me.
EDIT: OK found the issue. For whatever reason, the base64 padding character = at the end is being decrypted as 5 consecutive bytes containing the value 5. Here is a playground link that shows it fixed. https://play.golang.org/p/tf3OZ9XG1M
EDIT: As per matt's comments. I updated the fix function to simply remove all the PKCS7 block padding and use RawStdEncoding for the last base64 decode. This should now be a reasonable fix.

How to decrypt an encrypted AES-256 string from CryptoJS using Java?
However, if you're using SSL/TLS, this encryption is not very effective. Because, even as the password is sent encrypted, there is need to store the password in clear text on the server-side for this purpose - which is not advisable. It is better to securely hash your passwords for authentication.

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

","I've found the solution to my problem.
In fact the method publicEncrypt is a wrapper of OpenSSL and then it expect a public/private key on that format. A key from GPG won't do it.
By generating the private and public keys with the following command the code work as expected:
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

"24241923","OpenSSL EVP and CryptoJS","CryptoJS is said to be OpenSSL compatible what can be noticed running the demo.
Now I want to implement the same behavior using the OpenSSL EVP API: chipher a string using a passphrase and exchange the result with CryptoJS which must be able to decrypt it (knowing the passphrase).
My doubt is about the standard way to exchange the iv (which I see as the key of CryptoJS and OpenSSL compatibility).
How am I supposed to send the iv along with the ciphered message?
PS: Please do not concern about client-side encryption/decryption because I am comfortable with the use case.
Update
Ciphering with OpenSSL command line tool
$ echo ""Hello World"" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:""Secret Passphrase"" -e -base64

de.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8); // output: Hello World

In my use case I want to cipher using the EVP API instead of openssl command line tool.
I am missing how to ""package"" the ciphered text, iv and salt altogether in one string as it was on ""U2FsdGVkX18Z8dTy1NR6/gm+9IxmbuT8iCblIjvV76E=""

I took the Saju Pillai example as start point.
Update 3
My problem is about ""interchangeability"" of the ciphered text.

","It doesn't work because ""[t]he hash you get back isn't a string yet. It's a WordArray object. When you use a WordArray object in a string context, it's automatically converted to a hex string."" (source)
By using digest = CryptoJS.SHA512(digest+salted); digest is converted into a hex string.
If you change your PHP code to
$salt = ""secret"";
$password = ""azerty"";
$salted = $password.'{'.$salt.'}';

and return the digest as a hex string (digest + '' or digest.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex) will do) it will work.

","Ok @timothymctim 's response helped me. Actually, I think it's an issue about character encoding.
Here's a (strange) solution :
The PHP:
$salt = ""secret"";
$password = ""azerty"";
$salted = $password.'{'.$salt.'}';
$digest = hash('sha512', $salted, true);

for ($i = 1; $i < 5000; $i++) {

$digest = base64_encode($digest);

salted = password + '{' + salt + '}'
digest = CryptoJS.SHA512(salted);

for (var i=1; i<5000; i++) {

It seems this answer provides a working code in C# for that site. If this is true, then you can't reproduce this in CryptoJS, because CryptoJS only supports AES, whereas that example C# code uses Rijndael (note the block size of 256 bit).
AES is only defined for a fixed block size of 128 bit, but Rijndael supports 128, 192 and 256 bit block sizes. Both support key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bit. CryptoJS actually implements only AES, but that site does not use AES despite its name.

I tried this and works well to generate secure random characters.
const crypto = require('crypto');

var length = 22
var generated = crypto.randomBytes(Math.ceil(length / 2))
                      .toString('hex').slice(0, length);
//it returned ""14cf777d3ca307f5e78496""

How can I generate secure random characters not including given pattern in nodejs.
Ex: ['a', '2'], it should return secure chars without given pattern 14cf777d3cr307f5e78496
","The crypto module does not offer directly what you are looking for. 
Although, what you can do, is to keep recursively generating your crypto until none of the patterns are found inside.
For that, you can use the following:
async function generateRandomCrypto(length, patterns) {
    const generated = await crypto.randomBytes(Math.ceil(length / 2)).toString('hex').slice(0, length);

    let isValid = true;
    for (pattern of patterns) {
        if (generated.indexOf(pattern) !== -1) {
            isValid = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (!isValid) {
        return await generateRandomCrypto(length, patterns);
    }

    return generated;  
}

Now, the function will keep generating until it finds one that does not include any of the strings provided in the patterns array.
If you are somehow worried about any kind of performance impact - there is no need to.
Assuming your patterns are not single letter strings, it is very unlikely that they will appear in the random sequence - thus, the generation might run only once. 
And even if, I did a test for you - I ran this with a patterns array looking like that:

Thank you
","Encoding.Unicode is a (misleading) name used by Windows for the UTF-16LE encoding.
However the CryptoJS functions, when given a string, encode it to bytes using the (more common) UTF-8, not UTF-16LE:

The hash algorithms accept either strings or instances of CryptoJS.lib.WordArray. A WordArray object represents an array of 32-bit words. When you pass a string, it's automatically converted to a WordArray encoded as UTF-8.

So you will need to create a WordArray from the string yourself before passing it in to MD5. With a new enough CryptoJS there's a function to do that for you:
CryptoJS.MD5(CryptoJS.enc.Utf16LE.parse(str))

$scope.encryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt($scope.password, ""123"").toString(); 

Also just a tip, rather than alerting values, console.log will show you what the actual value is of the variable you're dealing with)

","You have multiple issues:

Your IV is a simple ASCII string, so you can easily parse it to a binary format with 
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""@1B2c3D4e5F6g7H8"");

Don't use your custom ""binary"" format with saltbytes.push(salt.charCodeAt(i)); or similar. You need to use CryptoJS' native format, which is available through
CryptoJS.enc.<Encoder>.parse(string)

The output size of PBKDF2 is specified with keySize and not keyBytes:
var key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(userPass, salt, {keySize: 256/32,      iterations: 2 });

The decryption function expects the ciphertext to be a CipherParams object. Good thing, duck-typing works:
var decMsg = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({
    ciphertext: encMsg
}, key, {
    iv: iv
});

The encrypted file has IV stored in the first 16 bytes, the rest is payload. During encryption key is formed by using hashing the password string via SHA-1 and using first 32 characters from the hex digest. I've gotten to the point where I can confirm that both IV and key used by CryptoJS is byte-wise identical to the ones used by other tools yet AES.decrypt() produces a buffer that I can't convert back to text.
Here's the decryption code. content and iv are binary strings read directly from file. password is a string with textual password. The code fails trying to convert the result to UTF8 (which I assume is due to the fact that decryption did not succeed).
function string2bytes(s) {
    var bytes = [];

    for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        bytes.push(s.charCodeAt(i));
    }

","Found a solution by sticking to WordArrays (even for the arguments where a binary string is ostensibly OK): The following function does work. The arguments are as follows:

data is a base64 string with encrypted text
password is a regular string with password
iv is a base64 string with an IV.

so
 function decryptData(data, password, iv) {
    var data = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(data);

You shouldn't be using the key or data derived from it as your initialization vector.

You should have shown us the code.
Your openssl call invokes the key derivation function to create a (better?) encryption key from the data you pass in the third parameter. OTOH, in crypto.js there is no implicit key derivation.

CryptoJS supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the
  variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase,
  then it will generate a 256-bit key.

You probabily need to pass the constant MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 when decrypting php-side

Does anyone have a working example of how to implement this interoperability scenario?
Other library such as Crypto can be used.
An example Base64 output is MF9lCR4DaW1R0adIe03VEw==
So the idea is to decrypt as follows:
var helloWorld = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(""MF9lCR4DaW1R0adIe03VEw=="", key).toString();

","You need the previously generated IV during decryption. It doesn't have to be secret, but it has to be unpredictable (which it is in your case). You can send it along with the ciphertext. A common way is to prepend it to the ciphertext and slice it off during decryption.
CryptoJS supports two types of encryption. If you pass the key as a string, it will use OpenSSL's key derivation function to derive a new key with a salt. You don't want that, because you're using an explicit key. For that, you need to pass the key as WordArray (CryptoJS' native binary data structure). Additionally, the ciphertext is expected to be either an OpenSSL formatted string or a CipherParams object:
var message = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({
    ciphertext: CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(""MF9lCR4DaW1R0adIe03VEw=="")

I have checked the LARAVEL_APP_KEY and I can see that it is prefixed

where I declare the key but this made no difference. 
I have also removed the object and tried encrypting a string which
produces the same result as above.

Additional question:
I'd also like to encrypt the string / object with something other than the LARAVEL_APP_KEY as I don't want to store that value in my VueJS application. The key doesn't need to be super secure however I would rather not use the LARAVEL_APP_KEY
","From my experience, I would suggest the following.
Firstly, I'm not sure why you are wanting to encrypt data on the server and then decrypt on the client. The only benefit that I could see for that is to prevent MITM attacks, in which case you should be using SSL.
Secondly, I'm fairly sure that the encryption key is the base64 encoded value after the prefix base64:. So you will need to remove this and then base64 encode the remaining string in VueJS before trying to decrypt with the key.
In answer to your question about encrypting/decrypting with anything other than the APP_KEY, you can't have multiple keys that will decrypt the same value. Cryptography only works when you have the correct key.
I would really not recommend decrypting data on the client, anybody can then obtain your encryption key and if there was a vulnerability elsewhere and were able to access your database, they could decrypt any data that they like.

var data = ""IFoRnqsmfPN9qKXu+oIKTIZxj1nRyVKP0FjGqefBZ8BMZ0ocBv9Hhfg560lM+CZhg00Yk29bn+/U5kOYNV9nSeTwdJTeXFX2H+m7ttE++1cJ7fjeYEiJv1JMvFRWm/PTZbmcmy+0pgXzuCzF0R3AEmEIuD+tpOX/Knc1FODIRNYb2yxKNW2iNRVKq9g/Qyuqn6w5Bp1cfdnTHNcNZL+GMHKoimKswgxPsR6NfbR/BMs"";

var key  = ""fdgfg787kim9om89"";

var aes = new pidCrypt.AES.CBC();
var decryptedData = aes.decryptText(crypted, key);

but it is returning null(no error), any guess what is wrong with this?

","This does not directly answer your question, but I think your overall approach is wrong. What you are trying to achieve is to have session data. You don't need to send this data to the client and back. That is not a very good practice. Instead you should store this data on the server, preferably in a database.
What you would do is to create a unique key, something randomly generated. You would store the user data using this key, and send the key to the client to be used on requests. You do it by setting it as a cookie variable as well. 
The user data can have additional fields variables for more secure access. Like the IP of the client, and possibly a expiry time for cleanup.

The issues are:

Encrypting source code files(not obfuscation, need encryption that can be ran).
Encrypting documents stored in mongodb, mainly username and passwords.
Mongodb login - is it possible to demand a username & password to open connection to the server?

Little bit of info: My project is to be installed on customer servers, so it's very important that the code will not be viewable and hopefully uncrackable(minimum security).


1 - For the first item, i found JXCORE and it seems promising, but i was unsuccessful at finding proof or reviews of users who used it in production.
Anyone can recommend other methods? or if anyone can review the option i listed i'll appriciate it.
2 -  For encryption i want to use AES256 and i found the library crypto-js to be able to answer the requirements.
Unfortunately, it doesn't provide assistance with node.js(none that i could find).
For example when i run this code, i want to see both the encrypted and the decrypted items:
var AES = require(""crypto-js/aes"");    
var temp = AES.encrypt(""Message"", ""secret password"").ciphertext.toString();
    console.log(temp);
    console.log(AES.decrypt(temp, ""secret password""));

Only the encrypted ciphertext is presented, not sure how to access the decrypted text.
On a side note, does anyone recommend using SHA3 combined with AES256?
What is the recommended approach for securing username&password mongodb DB?
If you got a documentation link or useful tutorial for crypto-js in node.js please link in the comments.
My JS skills aren't pro so it might be in there and i fail to see it, so apologizes if this was a noob thread.
Thanks.

"30295911","Converting a cryptojs MD5 script into PHP","I've got a piece of javascript which someone has written to convert an ID into a particular hashed ID used by a program.
Note that the javascript output cannot be changed. It replicates the hashing done by the above mentioned 3rd-party program. I am trying to likewise replicate the hashing in PHP.
My aim is to convert this into PHP, so I can run the conversion in some back-end scripts.
However, it uses the cryptoJS library, and I can't find a way to convert it to PHP properly, as the MD5 in cryptoJS seems to have an array passed to it, and the PHP MD5 is passed a string. See below for some code examples
What they have (javascript)
var id = bigInt(12345678912345678);
var parts = [0x42,0x45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];

for (var i = 2; i < 10; i++) {
    var res = id.divmod(256);
    id = res.quotient; 
    parts[i] = res.remainder.toJSNumber();
}

var wordArray = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(new Uint8Array(parts));
$(""#newid"").val(CryptoJS.MD5(wordArray));

What I've got in PHP
$id = 12345678912345678;
$parts = [0x42,0x45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];

for ($i=2; $i < 10; $i++){
    $quo = (int)($id / 256);
    $rem = $id % 256;
    $id = $quo;
    $parts[$i] = $rem;
}

$hash = md5($parts);
echo $hash;

This of course, returns an error due to MD5 not taking an array.
I've tried something simple such as join()ing the array, but that doesn't return the same hash.
I've had a look into the cryptoJS library, and I've done tons of google searches, and looked through SO (inc: Generate the same MD5 using javascript and PHP , SHA512 hashes differ on android, php and javascript etc) but can't seem to find anything which answers this question.
I have a feeling that the issue is me not understanding exactly what the wordArray is passing into the MD5 (and thus not being able to reproduce properly in PHP)... but I'm not familiar enough with the cryptoJS library to be sure.
Some output...

","The option to base64EncodedStringWithOptions is incorrect and will add line ending characters to the Base64 encoded iv and encrypted data.
You do not want line endings options, by default, no line endings are inserted. Just specify 0:
NSString *cipherText = [cipherData base64EncodedStringWithOptions:0];
NSString *ivText = [iv base64EncodedStringWithOptions:0];

The option Note that NSUTF8StringEncoding is not an encoding option for the method base64EncodedStringWithOptions. The options are:
NSDataBase64Encoding64CharacterLineLength
NSDataBase64Encoding76CharacterLineLength
NSDataBase64EncodingEndLineWithCarriageReturn
NSDataBase64EncodingEndLineWithLineFeed`

which are all line separator options.

To correctly convert the encryption key to NSData, I use the method provided here and call it like this:

The decrypt function of CryptoJS requires an object like this:
const encrypted = crypto.enc.Base64.parse(message.substring(24));

const params = {

","The IV must be the same for both encryption  and decryption. in the example a new random IV is being created for decryption: secureRandom.nextBytes(ivspec);.
You need to carefully and fully review the CryptoJS documentation to determine how the IV is being handled. Often the IV is prepended to the encrypted data for use during decryption.
The encryptedString seems to be Base64 encoded and the decoded length is 32-bytes, just right for a 16-byte IV and 16-byte encrypted data+padding.

Thanks!
","The reason that the output looks different is that the input to Base64 is different; the reason for that is that in the JavsScript code, you've called
key.toString()

So, in JavaScript, you have base64-encoded the 64-character string
""00d7a91fdf03a991ed324915ac893f08d99fca454f7c4169a1ac763c5f33e64f""

And jn Objective-C, you have base64-encoded the raw 32-byte sequence
0x00 0xd7 0xa9 0x1f 0xdf ... 0xe6 0x4f

In both cases, your PBKDF2 code has come up with the same key. You have just encoded the key differently in each case.
You can get CryptoJS to create the same Base64 output by serializing the key directly, like this:
key.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64)

(See https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#The_Hasher_Output for the documentation. You may have to include another script file for this output format to be available)

","There is a typo in your variable names. Check where you define decrypted and where you use it. You meant to use decrypted1.
Additionally, you have a problem with the encoding. The first decrypted1.toString(); will encode the string into Hex, but earlier you called encrypted1.toString(); which does not encode to Hex, but a special Base64 encoding (OpenSSL compatible). You will need to encode to UTF-8 in order to get to the same encoding that you had before during encryption.

var encrypted1 = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message2, key, {iv: iv, mode: CryptoJS.mode.CFB});
console.log(encrypted1); //xbPp9LFwl12hkLKwlvjpMaVj5Rss7YUbR0fP61wFXw8=

But if variable message1 == message2, I want to get the same encrypted text.
If I'll set iv and key as in second time - I'll get the next time the same result. But as first time I want to generate IV in encription function random. Is it possible?
","First of all, CryptoJS treats keys and passwords differently. If you provide a string it will automatically derive a key and IV from the password and a salt. So you will need to provide an identical salt if your keyString is indeed a string, or an identical IV if it is a key. 
You could prefix the IV (generated before calling encrypt) to the ciphertext if you want to retrieve it later on. If I'm not mistaken the salt is already put into the ciphertext for passwords (OpenSSL) compatible, so you can retrieve it from byte 8..15 after decoding.
Note that re-use of the IV or salt is normally not safe for any mode of operation (CFB in your example), although it depends on the mode of operation how unsafe a repeat of the IV is. It's fine for making a compare but I would not store multiple ciphertexts with identical IV or salt.
Usually there are better ways of creating the same functionality for peculiar schemes as you've described above.

","It turned out to be a problem with ExtendScript. If you're using minified versions of CryptoJS, make sure you switch to full js versions because for some reason ExtendScript will generate different values:

In this example, I give the equal weight to each of the 32 numbers (which seems reasonable since a hash is really not a number). But, you can give different weights to different bytes. For instance, you can give a weight of 2^31 to the first byte, and 2^30 for the second byte, etc. and normalize the final number accordingly.
Edit: You can also do the comparison for multiple bytes at a time. E.g., 16 numbers with each coming from 2 bytes, or 8 numbers with each coming from 4 bytes, etc. As you increase the ""unit"" size, the resulting final number will have a ""higher fidelity"" to the original hash value.

","The comment by Mörre contains the best answer. Simply take the first 52-bits of the hash (or any convenient 52 bits of the hash) and assign it to a javascript number. A 52-bit integer can be stored exactly as an IEEE 754 double. Then simply divide the number by 252, which should only effect the exponent bits of the number. The result is a floating point number x, 0 <= x < 1, with as much entropy as is possible given the constraints.

","digest is an HMAC method in the Node.js crypto module.  The equivalent method in CryptoJS is finalize.  The result of finalize is a CryptoJS WordArray object.  To get a hex string, use the WordArray in a context where it will be treated as a string.  Specifically, replace your:

I started using jshashes, but when I saw that the resultant hash (on the web app) was different from the one which I get locally using bash I decided to move to CryptoJS. But the result is the same,the hash from the uploaded file is still different.
Here's my code:
var reader = new FileReader();    
reader.readAsBinaryString(controller.file);
controller.fileHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(reader.result).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);

As you can see the code is quite simple, just reads the uploaded file from the variable using FileReader and convert the value into a BinaryString, hash the content and finally assign the result to another controller valriable to show it in the html.
In my shell (local environment) to get the file digest I run the following command:
$ shasum -a 256 [path/to/file]

In order to upload files, i'm using ng-file-upload
What I'm missing? If anyone can help me or guide me to see the solution I will be very greatful.
Thank you in advance.
Update 1:
As @destroyer said in the comments below readAsBinaryString is deprecated and it's an asynchronous method, so here's my actual code:
var reader = new FileReader();
reader.onload = function() {
    controller.fileHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(reader.result).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
};
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(controller.file);

I tried this solution in order to convert the ArrayBuffer object into a BinaryString. But the result is still wrong.
Update 2: 
Here's an image of a console log og the object I want to hash

","readAsBinaryString is deprecated, you should use readAsArrayBuffer.
Either way, those functions start an asynchronous operation, the result of which you read inside the FileReader instance's load event.
var reader = new FileReader();    
reader.onload = function(){
  controller.fileHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(reader.result).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
};
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(controller.file);

Reflecting on our conversation in comments: the problem was that crypto-js does not operate on binary files, but on strings.
You can get a SHA256 implementation that supports ArrayBuffers directly in js-sha256.

"35840228","PHP -- calculating correct HMAC signature as nodejs script","So I am working on a PHP script that queries an API which uses HMAC authentication headers. However, I have been banging my head trying to encode the HMAC signature correctly. I have a preexisting nodejs script to work from as a template. 
In the nodejs script, the HMAC signature is calculated using the following:
var crypto = require('crypto');
var hmac = [];
hmac.secret = 'ODc0YTM3YzUxODFlMWQ1YTdhMGQwY2NiZmE1N2Y1ODdjYzM5NTgyMDJhZjVkYTE4MmQxYzQ5ODk0M2QzNWQxYw==';
hmac.timestamp = 1457326475000;
hmac.path = '/account/';
hmac.message = hmac.path +'\n' + hmac.timestamp;
var sig = crypto.createHmac('sha512', new Buffer(hmac.secret, 'base64'));
hmac.signature = sig.update(hmac.message).digest('base64');

console.log(hmac);

This correctly calculates the HMAC signature as:
bWjIFFtFmWnj0+xHLW2uWVa6M6DpbIV81uyUWwRFCJUg+0Xyt40QWZWQjGvfPUB/JbjGZHUoso0Qv5JHMYEv3A==.
Meanwhile, in PHP, I am using:
<?php
$hmac['secret'] = 'ODc0YTM3YzUxODFlMWQ1YTdhMGQwY2NiZmE1N2Y1ODdjYzM5NTgyMDJhZjVkYTE4MmQxYzQ5ODk0M2QzNWQxYw==';
$hmac['nonce'] = '1457326475000';
$hmac['path'] = '/account/';
$hmac['message'] = $hmac['path'].""\n"".$hmac['nonce'] ;
$hmac['signature'] = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha512',$hmac['message'],
$hmac['secret'], true));

print_r($hmac);

The above code, will calculate the HMAC signature as:
vqP49m/bk9nA4S3nMqW2r+kc2+yBfwhY/jWGUfz6dlKJUMkC2ktiPnuCcymdSWl4XezZT5VKCATYfus86Hz/Gg==
Working from the principle that ""one million monkeys hacking away at a million keyboards""  might one day be able to encode a valid HMAC signature, I have even tested a loop that iterates through all the permutations of the above PHP code (with/without base64 encoding the message, secret; with/without binary encoding of the HMAC, etc.)... to no avail.
Any suggestions for this here, one exhausted simian?
","The problem is that you're not decoding your $hmac['secret'] first before passing it to hash_hmac().
Try:
$hmac['secret'] = base64_decode($hmac['secret']);

Client-side angular-js controller
$scope.authenticate = function () {      
  var auth = new login();
  auth.username = $scope.username;
  auth.password = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt($scope.password); //// HERE  

  auth.$save(function (response){

    console.log(""req.user: "",req.user);
    req.session.username = req.user[ldap.username];
    req.session.userModel = req.user;
    res.status(200).send({""success"": 'success'});
});
.....

On the server-side service before calling passport.authenticate with the request 'req' the aes encrypted password needs to be decrypted. How can that be implemented here? (The question is not about encryption but how to get data before it gets passed to passport.authenticate as request)
","@Abhijay Ghildyal I don't think they understood your question. It is indeed possible to intercept the request before it gets passed to passport.authenticate(). What you'd want to do is to add this passage of code to your express.js or whichever file you did your express server implementation in. Also I am decrypting the request.body here instead of req.user since at that point of time the user is not yet logged in, however if it's different in your case then that's fine you can decrypt req.user the same way. (The variable app here is the name of your server i.e var app = express();)
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    if(req.url === '/login'){
        //CryptoJS.AES.decrypt() is Assumed to be the decrypter function here.
        req.body = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(req.body);
        console.log(req.body); //To view decrypted body
    }
    next();
});

That is it. This middleware function will be reached first before the passport.authenticate() function. Just make sure if you're applying this to req.body you add these lines of codes first, after importing the bodyParser (bodyParser = require('body-parser');) before the passage above.
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true
}));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

On the javascript side, the code to create the encryption is:

var iterations = 100;

var message = ""This is my test"";
var password = ""thepassword"";

});

// convert encrypted message to hex
var encryptedHex = base64ToHex(encrypted.toString());

When I bring that into php, I can correctly pull back the pieces sent (salt, iv, message), but can't decode the message.
$text_key = 'thepassword';
$cipher = ""aes-256-cbc"";


$received_message = $_REQUEST['message'];

// Decode message and pull out pieces:
$decoded = base64_decode($received_message);

$hex_version = bin2hex($decoded);

// Pull out salt, iv and encrypted message

$encrypted_string = substr($hex_version, 96);

// Message key
$generated_key = bin2hex(openssl_pbkdf2($text_key, $salt, 32, 100, 'sha256'));

// Decode Message
$result = openssl_decrypt($text_encoded, $cipher, $generated_key, $options=0, hex2bin($iv));

If I replace $generated_key with the key displayed in the javascript console, however, the message decrypts successfully.
What am I doing incorrectly to generate the key in php? 
","After creating a routine to run through all possible algorithms for openssl_pbkdf2 and the hash_pbkdf2 functions, discovered that the hash_pbkdf2 function is the one that will create the key:
$generated_key = hex2bin(hash_pbkdf2('sha1', $text_key, hex2bin($salt), 100, 64, FALSE));

Once the right algorithm and size was in place, the decryption works as expected.

I have another service, a NodeJS server which uses CryptoJS.
My question is: How can I transform the C results ({0x17, 0x8d, 0xc3, 0xa1, 0x56, 0x34}) so it will match something CryptoJS could handle?

Edit:
Elaborating a bit. for the purpose of this discussion, the C result is transmitted over the network, so it should be transformed to a String. As far as I know, CryptoJS uses base64 as an input for it's AES method, decrypts to bytes that later can be converted to plain text:
var bytes  = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(BASE_64_STRING, SECRET);
var plaintext = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

The encrypted result for the same message + secret with CryptoJS is: U2FsdGVkX1/TAYUIFnXzC76zb+sd8ol+2DfKCkwITfY= (JS Fiddle) and changes on each run.
Update 2:
Thanks to @MDTech.us_MAN answer I've made some changes to both the JS and C code, but I'm still missing a puzzle pice.

    uint8_t in[7]  = { 'm','e','s','s','a','g','e'};

    struct AES_ctx ctx;

    AES_init_ctx_iv(&ctx, key, iv);
    AES_CTR_xcrypt_buffer(&ctx, in, 7);

    printf(""Encrypted: "");
    for(int i=0 ; i<7 ; i++){
        printf(""%.2x"" , in[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}

The encrypted HEX string C output: cba9d5bc84113c, when converted to Base64 result is :y6nVvIQRPA==
On the JS side, I'm explicitly using CTR mode with no padding, and initiating (hopefully) same iv like so:
const CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");
let iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('f0f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9fafbfcfdfeff'); // 16 Bytes (same as the C code)

console.log(message.toString());

The decrypted result: a47172dfe151c7 and not the expected result ""message"".

","You are doing two things

Encrypt
Convert to base64

Upon receiving, you must do the reverse operations of both of these, in the reverse order they were applied before transmitting

Convert from base64
Decrypt

You can also swap the order of the steps, but then the order must be swapped on both the transmitting and receiving sides.
Also make sure the secret is on the same format on both sides.

","You should read the CryptoJS documentation more carefully. By default it uses CBC mode for the encryption so you should change your tiny-AES implementation to use that.

CryptoJS supports the following modes:

CBC (the default)


Also note that CryptoJS has padding enabled by default, while tiny-AES doesn't have it at all. Therefore, messages must be multiples of 16. (Or you can manually use your own padding implementation)

No padding is provided so for CBC and ECB all buffers should be mutiples of 16 bytes. For padding PKCS7 is recommendable.

Then, notice that CryptoJS autoselects the AES variant by the key size:

CryptoJS supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key.

So, you must consider all of these factors in your tiny-AES code.

","First, you need to decode base64-encoded encrypted data to bytes.
Second, your encrypted data is salted and stored as described here:

Files have an 8-byte signature, followed by an 8(?)-byte salt. Following the salt is the encrypted data.
Files begin with an 8-byte signature: the ASCII characters ""Salted__"". 

So, you should extract both salt and actual encrypted data from “OpenSSL salted format”-ted string (Salted__{salt}{data}):

","I've looked at your PHP code. You're using a 32 character key which is obviously Hex-encoded, but instead of decoding it to bytes, you're using the characters directly. Therefore the aes-256-cbc cipher is also wrong.
If you don't want to change your misleading PHP code, you can simply make the same mistake in CryptoJS: CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(key) instead of CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(key).

Security considerations:
The IV must be unpredictable (read: random). Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. The IV is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption.
It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.

Just check at ffmpeg node_module if you have specific video stream url (m3u format) or just request if you have a file video url

On Node.js I have a next code

    }
).toString();

Then when I try to decode it with phpseclib
$key = 'A5178B6A965AACF3CD60B07A15061719';
$data = /*text encrypted by JS*/;
$cipher = new AES();
$cipher->setKeyLength(256);
$cipher->setKey($key);
$res = $cipher->decrypt($data);

And then $res becomes an empty string
What do I do wrong?
","If you pass in a string to CryptoJS.<cipher>.encrypt as a key, CryptoJS treats it as a password and will derive the actual key from that using OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey with a random salt and one iteration of MD5. 
phpseclib doesn't have an implementation of that, so you could just pass in the actual key:
var key256Bits = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('A5178B6A965AACF3CD60B07A15061719');

Since this key is only 32 hexits long, it only has 128 bit of entropy, but still uses AES-256. You need 64 hexits which you can decode before use to get 32 bytes for a secure key size.
Also, phpseclib implements PKCS#7 padding, so you need to use 
padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7

in CryptoJS.
Example JavaScript code:


var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('00000000000000000000000000000000'); //it's for tests, later it will be dynamically generated
var key256Bits = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse('A5178B6A965AACF3CD60B07A15061719');

var cipher = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(
    'Some text', 
    key256Bits, 
    {
        iv: iv,
        padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
    }
).toString();
console.log(cipher)
<script src=""https://cdn.rawgit.com/CryptoStore/crypto-js/3.1.2/build/rollups/aes.js""></script>



In PHP, you need to make sure to decode the ciphertext before use:
$data = base64_decode(""IWkBG3A46rNrxwWN2JD7xQ=="");

$key = 'A5178B6A965AACF3CD60B07A15061719';
$cipher = new AES();
$cipher->setKeyLength(256);
$cipher->setKey($key);
$res = $cipher->decrypt($data);
var_dump($res);


Security consideration:
If you're using only symmetric encryption you need the exact same key at the server and the client. If you send the encryption key from the server to the client or the other way around you need to encrypt your symmetric encryption key. The easiest way to do this would be to use TLS. If you use TLS, then the data as well as key are encrypted, so you don't need to encrypt it yourself. This doesn't provide any security, just a little bit of obfuscation. You should read: https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/

"47082971","Why CryptoJS produced different value every time the browser loads","Following code is run on a web page via script tag. Every time I load the page or run the code in the browser console - I am getting different value...
var key = 'key-123:456';
var uid = 1234567890;
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(id, key);
encrypted.toString();

How can I have single ""encrypted value""for ""single id"" regardless of how many times I load the page or run the code in console? 
","AES is a ""block"" cipher, which means it operates deterministically on fixed-length blocks from plaintext to ciphertext (and vice versa). However, it's typical (and generally preferred) to use a ""mode of operation"" that adds non-determinism to the encryption process. For example, CBC mode (which CryptoJS uses by default) XORs a random initialization vector with the plaintext before encrypting it (and, correspondingly, after decrypting it):

This is vastly preferred because otherwise an eavesdropper can detect duplicate blocks, which might allow an attacker to eventually understand what is being communicated -- undoing the entire point of your encryption.
However, it sounds like you want your encryption to have this specific weakness, which suggests to me that maybe you don't really want encryption at all. Instead, you might want a hash, which is a deterministic one-way transformation. (CryptoJS supports several hashes.) With a hash, a given input A will always hash to the same hash value H, so you can compare Hash(A) == Hash(B) to see if A == B. (This isn't a perfect comparison, since hashes have an infinite input space and finite output space, but hashes are deliberately designed so that it's very, very difficult to find two inputs that produce the same output.) This is how websites securely store your password: the service stores Hash(password) instead of password itself, then when a user submits a password entry, the sites compares Hash(entry) and Hash(password) to see if the entry is correct.
var hash = CryptoJS.SHA3(message);

However, if you really do need to reverse the transformed value back into plaintext and not just compare it to another hashed value, then you do need encryption. In that case, you can use the cryptographically inferior ECB mode, which has the weaknesses described above. In CryptoJS, you can do this by supplying an options object with a mode property:
CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(msg, key, { mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB });

This site will never hold any personal information, it's just for my own education.
So my question is:
Do I need to create a self signed certificate and add that to my Web Host, or pay money for that or can I just use CryptoJS to create a hash and then when it's on server side use php's password_hash() before saving it in the database?
","You are talking about two different things. First is SSL and encryption of network second is password hashing in db. To be secure you should use both SSL and password hashing. If you do not want to pay for signed certificate you can create own cert not signed by CA and give it to your friends (in secure manner) they should include it in browser or they should check certificate fingerprint each time they connect to site. Any one who do not have this cert or its fingerprint will not know it there is MITM and browser will complain about it.

"39854414","Encrypt/decrypt binary content on device using CryptoJS","I am working on an Ionic app in which I need to encrypt/decrypt files on the device (ipad).
Use case is that when user marks some files (docx, pdf etc) as sensitive, they are encrypted on the device. Whenever user needs to view any of these files, they are decrypted back and shown to the user.
I am using CrytoJS to encrypt/decrypt the file and $cordovaFile to read/write the file to the device.
Below is the code which encrypts the file on the device. First unencrypted file is read from the device, then it is encrypted and saved back to the device.  
return $cordovaFile.readAsBinaryString($rootScope.dataDirectory, 'abc.docx')
.then(function (binaryData) {
  console.log('Files read, now encrypt them '+binaryData);
  var encryptedWordArray = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(binaryData, '12345');
  return $cordovaFile.writeFile($rootScope.dataDirectory, 'abc.docx', encryptedWordArray.toString(), true)
})

This creates the encrypted file in the device but at this point I have no way to tell if the file was correctly generated except for the fact that it is not an empty file. In my example, the original docx file was 13KB but after encryption it is 23KB. 
Now, I am taking the same file and trying to decrypt it.
var decrypted = null;
return $cordovaFile.readAsBinaryString($rootScope.dataDirectory, 'abc.docx')
  .then(function(encryptedBinaryData) {
    console.log('Read encrypted file as a binary string '+encryptedBinaryData);

    var decryptedWordArray = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedBinaryData, '12345');
    decrypted = decryptedWordArray.toString();
    return $cordovaFile.writeFile($rootScope.dataDirectory, 'abc.docx', decrypted, true)
  })
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log('Decrypted file written');
  })

This generates a 34KB file on the device. However, when I try to open it, I get an error message stating that File is corrupt.
I think the problem could be somewhere related to dealing with multiple formats. When a file is read we get Binary content. Then CrytoJS gives a WordArray but before saving it to device it needs to be converted back to String. 
Any help would be much appreciated.

I have tried to follow some answers like this one: Decode a Base64 String using CryptoJS
But I either get errors such as ""Error: Malformed UTF-8 data"", or a different result than the expected hmacDigest.
I am not sure how I could find an alternative to the ""binary"" digest although I found this question: 
How to get digest representation of CryptoJS.HmacSHA256 in JS
The method is supposed to answer the following:

""Message signature using HMAC-SHA512 of (URI path + SHA256(nonce + POST data)) and base64 decoded secret API key""

This is the Nodejs version (with crypto):
const crypto = require('crypto')

function sign(path, params, secret) {
  const message = querystring.stringify(params)
  const secretBase64 = Buffer.from(secret, 'base64')
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256')
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secretBase64)

  const hashDigest = hash.update(params.nonce + message).digest('binary')
  const hmacDigest = hmac.update(path + hashDigest, 'binary').digest('base64')

  return hmacDigest
}

note: querystring is just an helper module that can also run in browsers: https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html
This is my attempt (wip) at implementing with crypto-js:
import cryptojs from 'crypto-js')

function sign (path, params, secret) {
  const message = querystring.stringify(params)
  const secretParsed = cryptojs.enc.Base64.parse(secret)
  const secretDecoded = cryptojs.enc.Utf8.stringify(secretParsed) // -> this throws an error as ""Error: Malformed UTF-8 data""

  const hash = cryptojs.SHA256(params.nonce + message).toString(cryptojs.enc.hex)
  const hmac = cryptojs.HmacSHA512(path + hash, secretDecoded).toString(cryptojs.enc.hex)
  return hmac
}

","Try this ! I think this is what you looking for !
const crypto = require(""crypto"")

    const secret = Buffer.from(secret, 'base64')
    let sign = params.nonce + message
    let hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)

Meteor.call('signedUrl', 'KW9EJhYtS6y48Whm2S6D', function(err, url){console.log(url)});

","To use Common Crypto from Swift

Add a bridging header
Add #import <CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h> to the header.

The example uses CBC mode and prefixes the encrypted data with the IV which is a method generally used for handling the IV.
Example from deprecated documentation section:
AES encryption in CBC mode with a random IV (Swift 3.0)
The iv is prefixed to the encrypted data
aesCBC128Encrypt will create a random IV and prefixed to the encrypted code.
aesCBC128Decrypt will use the prefixed IV during decryption.
Inputs are the data and key are Data objects. If an encoded form such as Base64 if required convert to and/or from in the calling method.
The key should be exactly 128-bits (16-bytes), 192-bits (24-bytes) or 256-bits (32-bytes) in length. If another key size is used an error will be thrown.
PKCS#7 padding is set by default.

decryptData: <636c6561 72446174 61303132 33343536>

Notes:
One typical problem with CBC mode example code is that it leaves the creation and sharing of the random IV to the user. This example includes generation of the IV, prefixed the encrypted data and uses the prefixed IV during decryption. This frees the casual user from the details that are necessary for CBC mode.
For security the encrypted data also should have authentication, this example code does not provide that in order to be small and allow better interoperability for other platforms.
Also missing is key derivation of the key from a password, it is suggested that PBKDF2 be used is text passwords are used as keying material.
For robust production ready multi-platform encryption code see RNCryptor.

As I have come to know, the randomness of the AES is one of the key aspects of it being secure therefore, this approach is not possible. I should not set the IV to repeat the pattern.
What is a more suitable approach to take here in this case? Other than getting all the ids and doing a client side decrypt and match?
Any pointers appreciated.
","As long as you use the same Key and the same IV (initialisation vector), you'll get the same result, e.g. 
const crypto = require('crypto');

function encrypt(plainText, keyBase64, ivBase64) {

    var key = Buffer.from(keyBase64, 'base64');
    var iv = Buffer.from(ivBase64, 'base64');

    /* Using 128 Bit AES with CBS. */
    var cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-128-cbc', key, iv);
    cipher.update(plainText, 'utf8', 'base64')

var keyBase64 = ""sTEhO2zJ8f2Lck59VppiCQ=="";

console.log('Ciphertext: ', cipherText);

var cipherText2 = encrypt(plainText, keyBase64, ivBase64);
console.log('Ciphertext 2: ', cipherText2);

You could also consider hashing the email and saving the hash, e.g.
var sha256 = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(plainText).digest(""hex"");
console.log('SHA256: ', sha256);

The hash will be stable for a given email body.

","CryptoJS is JavaScript library and can't be used in C# project. To do AES decrypt in C# you need to use .Net crypto library which is covered in this answer: Using AES encryption in C#.
In above linked answer you will see line that decrypts the string:
string decrypted = DecryptStringFromBytes(encrypted, myRijndael.Key, myRijndael.IV);

The 2nd parameter is where you can pass the key (I assume pki is byte array key that you used to encrypt the string). The 3rd parameter is the type of algorithm which you should make sure is in sync with CryptoJS when you encrypted the string.

","Your problem is that you encrypt with DES and decrypt with AES.
Also you are generating a key from passphrase on your Java code, but using it directly on your JavaScript code.
You use salt on the Java side, but do not appear to incorporate the salt in the message. Having the salt+passphrase you can recover the key and iv.
You will need to look around for a another set of examples that use AES on both ends, that generate the key in the same way, and uses the same padding. 
Something along the lines of this:
// Generate a temporary key. In practice, you would save this key

Which one of these encryption methods is best for storing encrypted values in a database? I need some method of encryption that lets the process convert the string back and forth in the same manner every time. 
For example: ""sadfjpihdsf3njdasf"" would convert to ""hello world"" and ""hello world"" always converts to ""sadfjpihdsf3njdasf"". The encryption methods I have tried yet seem to give me a different encrypted string each time.
The purpose of this is mainly to reduce the visibility of passwords stored in a secure database, so the level of security involved is rather basic.
","All the symmetric ciphers in CryptoJS can be used in the way you described. The reason you see a different value every time is because a new random IV is generated every time. You can generate the IV yourself for every unique value you have as seen here.
Generally, passwords are not encrypted, but iteratively hashed with a salt. So, when the user authenticates the next time, the application can hash the typed in password and check if the values match. The salt and the number of iterations would be stored in additional columns or along side the hash.
CryptoJS provides a good hashing method for this case if you want to do this on the client side or anywhere where JavaScript is runnable, because CryptoJS basically has no dependencies: PBKDF2

","You would want to encrypt information when you are moving it through an insecure channel (WiFi, or data cables that could be sniffed) or if you want to store documents that only a selected group of people should access.
For those applications you should check the cyphers that library provides (and investigate each one to consider their pro/cons).
But for a login implementation there's no a valid reason to be able to decrypt the user password. Nobody should be able to retrieve a password. The standard procedure is to ""hash"" the password. 
Like 'let me eat your password, digest it, and storage what's left'.
When the user want to authenticate with your application you do the same procedure with the password he/she provided and compare 'what's left' with what you have in your database.

Now I'm trying to see if it's possible to do progressive encryption/decryption using it. I currently use CryptoJs and there are many situations where I deal with chunked download and upload of files, meaning that files are broken into smaller pieces and the processing of those pieces are done separately. 
On CryptoJs it's possible to keep an instance of the ""Encryptor"" open so you can keep passing the chunks to it as you get them from the source and you can call a finalize() function when you're done.
I've been searching on Google and StackOverflow for hours for a way to achieve the same thing using WebCrypto but I can't find an answer.
Does anyone know how to do it or if it's even possible to be done using the current apis?
","Unfortunately WebCrypto API was not defined with streams support, there are a few reasons but I suspect the main two are that not all algorithms support this and it is the sort of thing that can be added later.

","The problem is with your PBKDF2 salts.  CryptoJS uses a WordArray as the primitive to store salts.  That is, an array of 32-bit values.  Where as C# uses 8-bit values (obviously, it is a byte array).
Notice then that, in JS:
var Salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create([1, 2]);

Is, in C#, the same as:
byte[] Salt = new byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2 };

You can demonstrate this by outputting the following in JS:
var Salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create([1, 2]);
console.log(Salt.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64));
-> AAAAAQAAAAI=

CryptoJS doesn't like strings to be used as salts.  It doesn't like it at all.  You shouldn't be using a string or phrase as the salt anyway, it should be randomly generated and stored alongside the password hash.

","Finally got a solution. Thanks to Luke Park who advised me that CryptoJS is using 4-byte (word) structure.
The issue which led to different results is that the key-size is (apparently) different. 
In C# 256/8 is actually 32 bytes length, however in CryptoJS, since using 4-bytes, 256/8 translates practically to 128 bytes length :(
Once I change the key size in the JS snippet to 256/32 ((256/32)*4 = 32) it worked perfectly and echo same results as the C# encryption method.
Thank you all

","Seems like the certificate in sample code and the certificate to be used are different. Try using below certificate I found in the URL you shared.

","As noted in the comments above, SSL is the only way you will acutally protect any data because

Without SSL, anyone could make changes to or sniff your Javascript or webpage and so it cannot be trusted.
Javascript really doesn't allow for non-character based data very well. (i.e. hashes, encoded video, etc.) as all data is usually silently converted to utf-16 or utf-8 internally.

This last point is likly what is causing your problem. The AES library on each end encrypts as if it had access to binary data, however, Javascript is telling the transfer that the encrypted data is in a certain characterset. You may want to try utf8decode or play with iconv() to get it converted to true binary data.

"19385412","Is correct to use CBC with NoPadding in AES Encryption?","I'm currently working with mcrypt.java To encrypt and decrypt data from server side and cryptojs on client side but I have some problems because when I encrypt any string, both java and JavaScript display different results.
Well, I was reading  about methods and padding schemes of AES encryption and some blogs talking about is incorrect to use CBC mode with NoPadding and is better/correct use CBC with Pkcs7 or another padding.
Anyone can explain me something related with that?
","Padding your plaintext is required if you perform AES encryption in ECB/CBC block cipher mode, unless your plaintext is a multiple of the blocksize. You could of course make sure that your plaintext is always precisely N blocks, but in effect you would be creating your own padding mode.
Many libraries (e.g. mcrypt in PHP) don't specify any padding while they secretly do pad. They just fill up the last block with 00 valued bytes. The effect of this is that you can encrypt ASCII compatible text, which will then be null terminated. In most languages (that do not use null termination) it is also possible to use a trim method to remove this padding. This is however not an official padding mode. Of course this scheme only works if your plain text does not end with control characters. So it is not suitable for any binary plaintext.
It is definitely better to use PKCS#7 padding. Removing PKCS#7 padding is deterministic for any plaintext. This means you can encrypt any value, including UTF-16 encoded text and any binary value. If PKCS#7 padding is not available it is relatively easy to implement it yourself - this is certainly worth the effort. The only disadvantage of PKCS#7 padding for CBC mode is that it may require an additional block of padding when the plaintext is already N times the block size. The reason for this is that the plaintext may otherwise be misinterpreted as being padding.
Note that padding and padding errors are not suitable to detect if the ciphertext was changed in transit. Padding Oracles are very easy to implement and may reveal your plaintext in 128 times the size of your plaintext in bytes (!!!). So use an authenticated mode of operation or a MAC (HMAC or CMAC) if you want to provide integrity and authenticity to your plaintext.
If you really cannot miss the bytes used for padding, please look at CTR or a similar stream mode of operation for your block cipher.

EDIT
there is also ciphertext stealing or CTS that can be used for CBC mode. It is not used much and as there are three different versions of it, you should make sure which one is used.
Nowadays it is more common to use counter mode (CTR mode) or an authenticated mode which is based on it (if a block cipher is used at all). CTR mode doesn't require any padding as it is a streaming mode of operation.

I know ""For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
""
But I don't know how to convert any length key to 128 bit format?
","When you pass CryptoJS a string as the key it treats it as a passphrase and generates the key from it using a key derivation function - in this case PBKDF2. It generates a 256 bit key and a 128 bit initialization vector (IV). It then uses those for the encryption/decryption. You also need to find out what chaining method CryptoJS uses (probably cipher block chaining (CBC)) and what padding method it uses (to make sure that the plain text is a round number of 128 bit blocks - probably PKCS#7).
CryptoJS has this ""works out of the box"" mode, but it isn't particularly clear what it's doing under the hood - you'd need to read the source code or scour the documentation.
When trying to inter-operate between two systems/languages it's best if you remain in charge of things, rather than letting one end make arbitrary decisions. That way you can make sure that you have the settings the same at each end.
So, you might choose to:

Use PBKDF2 to generate a 128 bit key and 128 bit IV from the string
passphrase - with, say, 9999 rounds
Use PKCS#7 padding
Use AES in CBC mode

The pointycastle package supports all the above in Dart. It looks like CryptoJS supports all of those too.
Start with a passphrase and make sure you can generate the same key and IV in JS and Dart. Then move onto creating the ciphers.
Remember, too, never to encrypt two messages with the same key/IV pair. Use a message sequence number, for example, to slightly change the IV for each message.

Then I read the encrypted startup_enc.dat file in base64 encoding. I decrypted the file and converted to base64 format. Then I wrote the decrypted plaintext to startup_dec.epub again in base64 encoding format.

The size of original epub file is 2.49 MB, encrypted file is 3.11 MB and the decrypted epub file is also 3.11 MB unlike 2.49 MB.
I am unable to find where the problem is, either in encryption or in decryption process. Can anybody help?

var text = '' + CryptoJS.Rabbit.encrypt(""12345"", ""PassPhrase"");

then this is posted with ajax to php and encrypted again:
function mc_encrypt($encrypt, $key){
    $encrypt = serialize($encrypt);
    $iv = mcrypt_create_iv(mcrypt_get_iv_size(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC), MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM);
    $key = pack('H*', $key);
    $mac = hash_hmac('sha256', $encrypt, substr(bin2hex($key), -32));
    $passcrypt = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, $encrypt.$mac, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);
    $encoded = base64_encode($passcrypt).'|'.base64_encode($iv);
    return $encoded;
}

Afterwards, this is stored in a database. If a user wants to access the value again, I retrieve it from the database and then decrypt it:
function mc_decrypt($decrypt, $key){
    $decrypt = explode('|', $decrypt);
    $decoded = base64_decode($decrypt[0]);
    $iv = base64_decode($decrypt[1]);
    $key = pack('H*', $key);
    $decrypted = trim(mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256, $key, $decoded, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv));
    $mac = substr($decrypted, -64);
    $decrypted = substr($decrypted, 0, -64);
    $calcmac = hash_hmac('sha256', $decrypted, substr(bin2hex($key), -32));
    if($calcmac!==$mac){ return false; }
    $decrypted = unserialize($decrypted);
    return $decrypted;
}

This is then posted back to the jQuery and decrypted again:
var text = CryptoJS.Rabbit.decrypt(text, ""PassPhrase"");
text = text.toString();
console.log(text);

However, the value logged in the console is quite different from the value ('12345') at the beginning. I don't know why this is happening and I've been looking at this problem for the last two days, yet I can't seem to figure out the problem...
","CryptoJS.Rabbit.decrypt is returning a word array, and you are calling toString on it. For ""12345"" I would guess that the result you are seeing is ""3132333435"".
Use CryptoJS stringify, e.g. CryptoJS.enc.Utf16.stringify(text) or CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(text), depending on the original encoding.
You can choose the encoding on the way in by modifying your code like this, for example:
p = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""12345"");
text = '' + CryptoJS.Rabbit.encrypt(p, ""PassPhrase"");

Then on the return trip:
var text = CryptoJS.Rabbit.decrypt(text, ""PassPhrase"");
text = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.stringify(text); // use same encoding as original input
console.log(text);

I am using the API Key to authenticate and CryptoJSv3.1.2 to handle the encryption.

The issue that I am having is that my request for accounts is being rejected and the message I'm getting back from Coinbase is {""errors"":[{""id"":""authentication_error"",""message"":""request timestamp expired""}]}
I am aware the of the 30 second restriction for requests however I am using the Coinbase server time that I am getting back from the Get Current Time call.

All of the included files are present  (I do Right-Click → View Source, then individually click on each of the .js files, and I see them).
If I run it exactly as above, I get error:
TypeError: Base64 is undefined

at cipher-core.js, line 619.
In addition to why does it not work, I have a general question about AES in CryptoJS: where is the mode of operation (CBC, etc.), the block size (AES-128, 192, 256), and the initialization vector?  (I guess that CrytpoJS.AES invokes some default).  Please clarify, or point me to any documentation (which I can't seem to find).
","The problem with your code is the decrypt function takes input as object not the only string.

In above code, you can see output.ciphertext attribute is displayed only but object is passed.
Since I have used cryptoJS earlier for my college project, that AES.js file is used by me. that file is giving me correct output. Maybe there's problem in aes.js file.
Here aes.js file that I used.

The problem is definitely not in the CryptoJS package since when calculating the string 'hello' using the script generates the following output:

And using the online tool you get the same (in uppercase):

The problem is definitely in the format of the data after loading it or the way of using it.
When i use Java to calculate SHA1 i get the same result by calculating it on the files byte array, so it points to the fact that the bytearray i get using this script is somehow different / partial.
","According to the manual for .ajax you need to set the dataType option to text, otherwise it will try to guess the type and then text is never an option.

","We managed to solve this eventually, the solution is pure JS with no Ajax involved:
$(document).ready(function(){

var url = utils.getUrlVars() && utils.getUrlVars().url;

if (!url) throw ""error - no URL was found. set 'url' in query string."";

var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.open(""GET"", url, true);
oReq.responseType = ""blob"";

oReq.onreadystatechange = function(e) {

    if (oReq.readyState == 4 && oReq.status == 200) {
        console.log('xhr success');
        success(e);
    } else if (oReq.readyState == 4 && oReq.status != 200){
        console.log('xhr error');
        error(e);
    }
}

var success = function() {
    var blob = oReq.response; 
    var sha1 = CryptoJS.algo.SHA1.create(); 
    var reader = new FileReader();
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

    reader.onload = function(e) {
        var arrbuffer = e.target.result.slice(0, e.target.result.byteLength);
        var bytes = CryptoJS.enc.u8array.parse(new Uint8Array(arrbuffer));
        sha1.update(bytes);
        var sha1res = sha1.finalize().toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
        // print results
        console.log('sha1 - success', sha1res);
    }
};

var error = function(){
    IJavaScriptImplementer.onError(JSON.stringify(error));
    IJavaScriptImplementer.log(JSON.stringify(error));
}

oReq.send(null);

As you cam see, the file is requested as a blob and is being read as one slice (you can also do it slice by slice but in my case the files are small), then the bytes are read and calculated into the SHA1 value.

secretKey should probably not be exposed like that. What would be a smart way to deliver that value?
","There are a few security issues.

The encryption key needs to be unique for each user.
Use a full length key: 128, 192 or 256 bits for AES.
It is best to use a full length encryption key of random bytes obtained from a CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator).
Using a string for the key, especially a short one is not secure. If you need the user to enter a password use a key derivation function such as PBKDF2 (Password Based Key Derivation Function 2) function to derive a secure encryption key.
There needs to an IV (Initialization Vector) supplied and it needs to be a random byte array from a CSPRNG unique for each encryption. Just prefix the encrypted data with the IV for use during decryption, it does not need to be secret.
It is best to fully specify all encryptions parameters such as mode and padding for interoperability.
If there is the possibility of entering an incorrect key or an attacker replacing a file add encryption authentication.
Add a version indicator to the encrypted data so changes can be made in the future if necessary.
Finally, how are you going to store the encryption key, there is no easy answer to that.

I have tried to use CryptoJS to replicate the same functionality, but it's not giving me the equivalent encrypted base64 string. Here's my CryptoJS code - 
function encryptString(encryptString, secretKey) {
    var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('Ivan Medvedev');
    var key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(secretKey, iv, { keySize: 256 / 32, iterations: 500 });

    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(encryptString, key,{iv:iv);
    return encrypted;
}

The encrypted string has to be sent to a server which will be able to decrypt it. The server is able to decrypt the encrypted string generated from the C# code, but not the encrypted string generated from JS code. I tried to compare the encrypted strings generated by both the code and found that the C# code is generating longer encrypted strings. For example keeping 'Example String' as plainText and 'Example Key' as the key, I get the following result -

JS - 9ex5i2g+8iUCwdwN92SF+A==

The length of JS encrypted string is always shorter than the C# one. Is there something I am doing wrong? I just have to replicated the C# code into the JS code.
Update:
My current code after Zergatul's answer is this - 
function encryptString(encryptString, secretKey) {
    var keyBytes = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(secretKey, 'Ivan Medvedev', { keySize: 48 / 4, iterations: 1000 });
    console.log(keyBytes.toString());

    // take first 32 bytes as key (like in C# code)
    var key = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(keyBytes.words, 32);
    // skip first 32 bytes and take next 16 bytes as IV
    var iv = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(keyBytes.words.splice(32 / 4), 16);

    console.log(key.toString());
    console.log(iv.toString());

    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(encryptString, key, { iv: iv });
    return encrypted;
}

As illustrated in his/her answer that if the C# code converts the plainText into bytes using ASCII instead of Unicode, both the C# and JS code will produce exact results. But since I am not able to modify the decryption code, I have to convert the code to be equivalent of the original C# code which was using Unicode.
So, I tried to see, what's the difference between both the bytes array between ASCII and Unicode byte conversion in C#. Here's what I found - 
ASCII Byte Array: [69,120,97,109,112,108,101,32,83,116, 114, 105, 110, 103]
Unicode Byte Array: [69,0,120,0,97,0,109,0,112,0,108,0,101,0,32,0,83,0,116,0, 114,0, 105,0, 110,0, 103,0]

So some extra bytes are available for each character in C# (So Unicode allocates twice as much bytes to each character than ASCII).
Here's the difference between both Unicode and ASCII conversion respectively -

So since both the key and iv being generated have exact same byte array in both Unicode and ASCII approach, it should not have generated different output, but somehow it's doing that. I think it's because of clearBytes' length, as it's using its length to write to CryptoStream.
I tried to see what's the output of the generated bytes in the JS code is and found that it uses words which needed to be converted into Strings using toString() method.  
keyBytes: 7bd512528df9b6daf71ff653504dc386e65c007de8d2877391c18cefe4e1b70d654a2eb12ee944fc53a9d30df93d76a7

iv: 654a2eb12ee944fc53a9d30df93d76a7

Since, I am not able to affect the generated encrypted string's length in the JS code (No access to the write stream directly), thus still stuck here.
","Here is the example how to reproduce the same ciphertext between C# and CryptoJS:
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    byte[] plainText = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(""Example String""); // this is UTF-16 LE
    string cipherText;
    using (Aes encryptor = Aes.Create())
    {
        var pdb = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(""Example Key"", Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""Ivan Medvedev""));
        encryptor.Key = pdb.GetBytes(32);
        encryptor.IV = pdb.GetBytes(16);
        using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
        {
            using (CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, encryptor.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write))
            {
                cs.Write(plainText, 0, plainText.Length);
                cs.Close();
            }
            cipherText = Convert.ToBase64String(ms.ToArray());
        }
    }

    Console.WriteLine(cipherText);
}

And JS:
var keyBytes = CryptoJS.PBKDF2('Example Key', 'Ivan Medvedev', { keySize: 48 / 4, iterations: 1000 });
// take first 32 bytes as key (like in C# code)
var key = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(keyBytes.words, 32);
// skip first 32 bytes and take next 16 bytes as IV
var iv = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(keyBytes.words.splice(32 / 4), 16);
// use the same encoding as in C# code, to convert string into bytes
var data = CryptoJS.enc.Utf16LE.parse(""Example String"");
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, key, { iv: iv });

","TL;DR the final code looks like this - 
function encryptString(encryptString, secretKey) {
    encryptString = addExtraByteToChars(encryptString);
    var keyBytes = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(secretKey, 'Ivan Medvedev', { keySize: 48 / 4, iterations: 1000 });

    var iv = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(keyBytes.words.splice(32 / 4), 16);
    var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(encryptString, key, { iv: iv, });
    return encrypted;
}

function addExtraByteToChars(str) {
    let strResult = '';
    for (var i = 0; i < str.length; ++i) {
        strResult += str.charAt(i) + String.fromCharCode(0);
    }
    return strResult;
}

Explanation: 
The C# code in the Zergatul's answer (Thanks to him/her) was using ASCII to convert the plainText into bytes, while my C# code was using Unicode. Unicode was assigning extra byte to each character in the resultant byte array, which was not affecting the generation of both key and iv bytes, but affecting the result since the length of the encryptedString was dependent on the length of the bytes generated from plainText.
As seen in the following bytes generated for each of them using ""Example String"" and ""Example Key"" as the plainText and secretKey respectively - 
ASCII

The JS result was similar too, which confirmed that it's using ASCII byte conversion - 
keyBytes: 7bd512528df9b6daf71ff653504dc386e65c007de8d2877391c18cefe4e1b70d654a2eb12ee944fc53a9d30df93d76a7

iv: 654a2eb12ee944fc53a9d30df93d76a7  

Thus I just need to increase the length of the plainText to make it use Unicode equivalent byte generation (Sorry, not familiar with the term). Since Unicode was assigning 2 space for each character in the byteArray, keeping the second space as 0, I basically created gap in the plainText's characters and filled that gap with character whose ASCII value was 0 using the addExtraByteToChars() function. And it made all the difference.
It's a workaround for sure, but started working for my scenario. I suppose this may or may not prove useful to others, thus sharing the findings. If anyone can suggest better implementation of the addExtraByteToChars() function (probably some term for this conversion instead of ASCII to Unicode or a better, efficient, and not hacky way to do that), please suggest it.

which is available as Plunker http://plnkr.co/edit/vmBtH8B2EKsdcfZVGlMH.
What I am trying to do in the original page is recalculate the hash as someone types into the form field, and the input field definition looked like this
<input id=""password"" ng-model=""password"" type=""text"" placeholder=""Password"">

and the ng-bind is really ng-bind=""sha1(password)"", but the simple static case in the Plunker exhibits the same behavior. 
I gather that the infdig error has to do with too many $digest cycles, but I don't see how that would happen here. It looks like the hash computation triggers the error, because returning a static string from the sha1 function causes no error.
","Providing ng-bind=""sha1('bar')"" makes the digest cycle unstable, everytime sha1 function returns a different object (reference is different) and your digest cycle has to run again to stabilize it and every digest cycle again evaluates the ng-bind function expression and it goes on till it reaches the max limit set (10). You can also easily replicate this issue by just doing return [] in your scope method. This is just a side effect of not so good practice of binding a function expression to ng-bind as it runs every digest cycle, if at all used it should be carefully evaluated.
One simple solution is to bind ng-change/ng-blur event on your password or any other trigger and just bind ng-bind to a property instead of a function expression.


angular.module('app',[])

I am new to encryption and hope someone could explain whether Bcrypt or Crypto would be better in this instance.
I am currently using Crypto and it seems to be working fine, however, from a security standpoint, I would like to know if changing it to Bcrypt would be better.
From the research that I have gathered, I see that Bcrypt is good for passwords due to the hashing, but that is the extent of it.  So is it fair to say that Bcrypt is good for data in which you are not returning data back to the client (i.e. passwords)?
","Bcrypt is a hashing function as stated in Wikipedia and README of its npm package. And it is really a good one.
Node.js' built-in crypto library on the other hand provides various kinds of encryption/hashing techniques.
If you plan to encrypt the ""applications"" in a reversible manner, use crypto, otherwise go with bcrypt.

","An AES key consists simply of random bytes. So for a 128 byte key you can just do:
var key = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(128/8);

and to encode it:
var keyBase64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(key);

Of course the key won't be identical to the one you generated before, you need to decode the previously generated base 64 encoded key to do that.

To use the key, use the explicit key parameters:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", key, { mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB});

PKCS#7 padding - which is identical to PKCS#5 padding - is already the default and ECB doesn't use an IV.

"53716552","OpenSSL and CryptoJS SHA256 encryption conversion","My problem is that the newer versions of OpenSSL aren't compatible with default settings of CryptoJS.

The default hash used by openssl enc for password-based key derivation
  changed in 1.1.0 to SHA256 versus MD5 in lower versions.
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/344150/why-can-one-box-decrypt-a-file-with-openssl-but-another-one-cant/344586#344586

By default, CryptoJS uses MD5 for its key derivation. OpenSSL used MD5, but now in OpenSSL versions >=1.1.0 it's using SHA256.
So if I pass -md md5 to OpenSSL, CryptoJS is compatible:
echo ""Hello World"" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md md5 -pass pass:""Secret Passphrase"" -e -base64

output: U2FsdGVkX19aufvaqQQ89scaApBos6oFCyqPj7IKUFk=
CryptoJS:
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt('U2FsdGVkX19aufvaqQQ89scaApBos6oFCyqPj7IKUFk=', 'Secret Passphrase').toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

output: ""Hello World""

But now if I want to use SHA256 instead of MD5 (removing the -md md5):
echo ""Hello World"" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:""Secret Passphrase"" -e -base64

output: U2FsdGVkX1/5LLkFkTpawh1im4a/fCco5hS42cjn/fg=
CryptoJS:
CryptoJS.AES.decrypt('U2FsdGVkX1/5LLkFkTpawh1im4a/fCco5hS42cjn/fg=', 'Secret Passphrase').toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

output: null
How do I tell CryptoJS to use SHA256 instead of MD5 for its key derivation?
","It seems that CryptoJS ""as-is"" does not provide this flexibility. This is because the use of MD5 is hard coded into the function used to derive the key from the passphrase. You can see it happening here in OpenSSLKdf:
var key = EvpKDF.create({ keySize: keySize + ivSize }).compute(password, salt);

KDF stands for Key Derivation Function, and no digest is provided when it is created. That EvpKDF.create() in itself does have the possibility for different types of digests, as you can see in its configuration options:
        cfg: Base.extend({
            keySize: 128/32,
            hasher: MD5,
            iterations: 1
        }),

It also shows that MD5 is the default.
All of this implies that the decryption will work if you modify that first line to the following:
var key = EvpKDF.create({ keySize: keySize + ivSize, hasher: C_algo.SHA256 }).compute(password, salt);

and indeed, after editing (as a test) that file cipher-core.js in your locally installed module, your last line of code does result in the desired Hello World.
The only way I see to reproduce this without modifying the CryptoJS module itself is by duplicating a whole chunk of code from the module into your own code.

The key must be randomly generated. This is an example 16 byte key (32 hexits) and it has to have a specific length. AES supports key sizes of 16, 24 and 32 bytes (32, 48, 64 hexits).
The IV is generated randomly for every encryption, so it is not possible to encrypt the same text with the same key in CryptoJS and Phalcon to check compatibility. It is necessary to encrypt in one and decrypt in the other.
Symmetric encryption without authentication can be very dangerous. It might be possible to mount a padding-oracle attack in your case. A common way to add authentication is to run a message authentication code over the IV + ciphertext with a separate key. HMAC-SHA256 with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme is a strong choice in that regard.
If the ""key"" is passed as a string to CryptoJS.AES.encrypt, then it invokes an OpenSSL compatible key derivation function (EVP_BytesToKey). The given ""key"" is assumed to be a password, therefore it generates a random salt, and derives the actual key and IV from those two.
Phalcon uses mcrypt, which is abandonware and has many bugs.

","The code you've provided generates a one-way hash. If you use this, then you validate passwords by comparing hashed values. There is no way to decrypt the existing password. If the user forgets their password, then you do a password reset.
If you really want to have retrievable passwords, then you need to look at encryption rather than hashing algorithms. For this type of application, symmetric key encryption, such as AES may be suitable.
Keep in mind that encryption is computationally much more expensive than hashing, and less secure. Hashing is nearly always preferred for passwords. Unless there is some extremely compelling reason to have retrievable passwords, you should steer your client towards one-way hash passwords.

We are using Jwt for API authentication. We have one endpoint url which takes username and password (POST request) and authenticate the user using django backends. We have deployed both the application on APACHE HTTP Server and using SSL (Https) for encryption. 
But we also want to encrypt the request payload (data sent to the django API). In current case encrypt the username and password from angular app and decrypt the corresponding data in django. For this, we are using CryptoJs in angular app and Pycrypto in Django. But we are unable to decrypt the data in django.
Here is the decrypt function code we are using on django app:
MODE = AES.MODE_CBC

key = 'k%eu6sy)h&vue#5yrpok#1)^1ya#l1t('

def decrypt(ciphertext,key, mode):
    encobj = AES.new('k%eu6sy)h&vue#5yrpok#1)^1ya#l1t(', AES.MODE_CBC)

","
Can somebody suggest, is this the right approach to go

Why do you want to encrypting the payload separately (outside ssl)? 
When it comes to credentials (username, password), if you encrypt in the browser, you need to have a key inside the script somewhere. That doesn't add anything to security, only increases the solution complexity. 
You may use an asymmetric cipher (RSA, ECC) to encrypt data using server's public key. Oh, wait - HTTPS does that already for you.
Client side encryption may have its place where you don't want the server to access the data (e.g. secured messaging, password manager, ..), however for username and password the server needs to read and process the credentials anyway. 

But we are unable to decrypt the data in django.

Here we have no idea how do you encrypt data on the client side. You may try to edit your question and add the encryption code and error message

or we should change the approach and do something else

Though there are definitely some issues in your code (I am unable to tell if it's all of them)

ciphertext (encrypted data) are usually binary (having non-printable characters). That's why when passing as parameters, the data are usually encoded to printable common characters (hex, base64, ..). I see you directly decrypt the parameters, are you sure the data are not encoded / posted  correctly?
I see you are not using any IV (initialization vector for CBC mode). I assume you library used will just use zero array IV. Using static / zero IV is VERY unsafe for CBC mode (or any mode generally). Are you sure the client doesn't include some sort of IV? 
CBC mode is malleable, you should apply some integrity check (with the integrity secret in the client script it doesn't add any value either)

This all is already done (and done well) using HTTPS, so so you are just trying to implement another layer of encryption with not really added value (and as well with apparent weaknesses). I believe common advice here is to lean on HTTPS with confidence

","I do not have any experience with CryptoJS but after a quick search I found the following.
The message parameter is the text you want to encrypt.
The password parameter is needed when you want to decrypt the message.

// Encrypt our secret message.
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(secretMessage, ""Secret Passphrase"");

// Decrypt our message.

","This line:

Is not the same as this line:
let salt: [UInt8] = Array(""0000000000000000"".utf8)

The utf8 encoding of ""0000000000000000"" is, in hex, 30303030303030303030303030303030 (0x30 is the UTF-8 encoding of the character ""0"").
What you meant to use here is Array(repeating: UInt8(0), count: 16).
You're also outputting a Base64 string in JavaScript, and a hex string in Swift, which are not the same things.
Unrelated side-note: 
This implementation is working pretty hard to get little security.  If your password is static, you could do much better by using a random key (i.e. 32 completely random bytes 0-255, not a string of characters). PKBDF2 isn't really buying you much here, excepting slowing down the system (not slowing down the attacker; just your app). Adding a random IV would significantly improve this system as well with little cost.

The final hex output is just that first concatenation and hmac concatenated. This reinforces my suspicion that it might be CryptoJS's fault because the output concatenation works and is between two sjcl variables.
I tried using SJCL random bit arrays but had some trouble. SJCL's generator, prng, did not work when using 
new sjcl.prng.randomWords(32/4);

or

And sjcl.random.randomWords does not seem to work anymore.
","CryptoJS (WordArray) and SJCL (bitArray) have different internal representations of data. You can't simply concatenate them.
The easiest way would be probably to encode it into an intermediate format such as Hex and let the other side decode into its internal format:
message = sjcl.bitArray.concat(version, sjcl.codec.hex.toBits(iv.toString()));

WordArray#toString() automatically uses Hex encoding. You would have to do this for all lines, but this is a little overkill, since you can concatenate Hex strings as strings:
message = sjcl.codec.hex.toBits(""03"" + iv + encryption_salt + hmac_salt + iv);

This should work as expected, because adding a WordArray such as iv to a string automatically calls its toString() function which in turn produces a big-endian hex-encoded string.
I wonder why you're using iv twice. Perhaps you meant options on one of them.

What needs to change:
function convert(wordArray){
    return sjcl.codec.hex.toBits(wordArray.toString());
}
var message = ""0301"" + encryption_salt + hmac_salt + iv;

var ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, encryption_key, {iv: iv}).ciphertext;

message += ciphertext;

","In addition to Jem's answer...
If you want to hardcode a key, then you can do many things, but all of them should involve some kind of code obfuscation, because a client might just open the developer tools and read the key.
Ways to hardcode the key, here are two simple ways that don't leak the key to the global object ...

In the local scope of the function that does the encryption/decryption
function decryptByDES(cipherTextString) {
    var keyHex = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""mykeystring12345"");
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.DES.decrypt({
    //...
}

In an wrapper scope (here used in an IIFE), but not in global scope
(function(){
    var keyHex = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""mykeystring12345"");
    function decryptByDES(cipherTextString) {
        var decrypted = CryptoJS.DES.decrypt({
        //...
    }
})();


A few things to note:

If you hardcode the key, then this doesn't provide any real security if the file the key is in is transmitted insecurely. You definitely need HTTPS, but if you have HTTPS you likely don't need the encryption provided by CryptoJS. (Ref)
DES supports only one key size of exactly 8 bytes. If you cannot supply keys (which should look like random noise), then you're probably supplying a password, which does not need to have this specific length requirements. Since passwords cannot be used as keys, you will need to derive a key from that password. CryptoJS supports PBKDF2 for that. If you're supplying a key that does not have the required size, then you will get strange results, but don't expect an error from CryptoJS.
Don't use DES nowadays. It only provides 56 bit of security. AES would be a much better, because it's more secure with the lowest key size of 128 bit. There is also a practical limit on the maximum ciphertext size with DES. See Security comparison of 3DES and AES.
Never use ECB mode. It's deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. You should at the very least use a randomized mode like CBC or CTR. It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.

","I don't know Coldfusion, but it looks like you're using the same password to derive a key and IV from it, but each of them differently.
You can do this in CryptoJS:
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""dotterbloem20151"");
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(iv);

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(ident, key, {iv: iv});

This is a strange way to derive a key, because the 16 character password is encoded to Base 64 resulting in 24 encoded characters. 16 bytes and 24 bytes are both valid key sizes for AES, but using Base 64 to derive a key is at the very least strange.

This code is not very secure. If you have passwords, then you need to derive the key from that password in a secure fashion. You would need to utilize PBKDF2 with a random salt and many iterations. See How to securely hash passwords?
The IV also has to be randomly generated. It doesn't have to be secret, so you can simply send it along with the ciphertext.

const cipherText = cipherBytes.toString();

// This works fine on my local machine
console.log('Decrypted', CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherText, key, opts).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

For example, here is a sample cipherText from a run 

U2FsdGVkX19wrG5ar3MGcBf8EXxDyO7HuE9vvaTsBvA=

This string gets stored in Firebase.
Next I upload the cipherText to firebase. My angular app will read it and get the error. Note that the angular app has no problem decrypting ciphers that it encrypted. The problem is trying to decrypt ciphers encrypted on my local Mac.
I am suspecting this has to do with how a Mac represents binary data vs Google's servers, but not sure what the solution is here

The Authorization header is computed as following:
Authorization = “APIAuth” + “ ” + TetherAPIKey + “:” + Signature;
Signature = Base64( HMAC-SHA1( TetherAPISecret, StringToSign ) );
StringToSign = Content-Type + “,” + Content-MD5 + “,” + URI + “,” + Timestamp;

","CryptoJS encodes by default to Hex when you force the WordArray to be converted to string, but Content-MD5 must be Base 64 encoded (judging from the ruby code of the project).
Try:

    var t = d.getTime();
    var o = t + """";

Now I have ported it over to use OpenSSL method my new code is

    md5(
        utf8_encode(
            ""MobileAppSecureKey""
        ),
        true
    ), 
    0, 
    base64_decode(""cTOCJ/iYL18="")
)

But the new code does not work, It gives the error error:0606506D:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:wrong final block length from openssl_error_string()
I'm unsure why it's complaining about final block length when this worked perfectly in mcrypt
The code used to generate the test data was from the mobile the mobile app is a Cordova app and uses the CryptoJS library
key = CryptoJS.MD5(key);

// copy 3DES subkey 1 to the last 64 bit to make a full 192-bit key
key.words[4] = key.words[0];
key.words[5] = key.words[1];

if(typeof(iv) === ""undefined""){
    iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(8);
}

var encrypted = CryptoJS.TripleDES.encrypt(pt, key, {iv: iv});
return {""str"":encrypted.toString(), ""iv"":CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(iv)};

The Encrypted payload was
{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""events.enableParentGenres"",""params"":[159],""id"":1}

Modifications that have been tried, 
As per yivi suggestion, options have been set to OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING
As per Tuckbros suggestion, the message has been padded 
$message_padded = base64_decode(""bkCfcseIt/TPsgNCdyX9fv2/4MjOJdaPXakNNbxQT3n6tXHa5bDoXojQ3g7jPLCu+wjwD0guQzw3hCFUSVx47PmDNHASk7g/kJ4K4tX0VGI="");
$message_padded = str_pad($message_padded,
        strlen($message_padded) + 8 - strlen($message_padded) % 8, ""\0"");

Both of these prevented the error about final block length however the encrypted payload when running through the code did not decrypt.
","The parameters you are passing in openssl_decrypt seem to be wrong; you are passing the OPTIONS parameter as 0, which you have to set to OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING because you provide the function with raw data (base64_decode).
The key also needs to be converted to a 192 bits key, as in the javascript code:
$key = md5(utf8_encode(""MobileAppSecureKey""), true);

//key.words[4] = key.words[0];
//key.words[5] = key.words[1];

for($i = 0; $i < 8; $i++) {
    $key[$i + 16] = $key[$i];
}

Try this one out:
$key = md5(utf8_encode(""MobileAppSecureKey""), true);
$data = base64_decode(""bkCfcseIt/TPsgNCdyX9fv2/4MjOJdaPXakNNbxQT3n6tXHa5bDoXojQ3g7jPLCu+wjwD0guQzw3hCFUSVx47PmDNHASk7g/kJ4K4tX0VGI="");

for($i = 0; $i < 8; $i++) {
    $key[$i + 16] = $key[$i];
}

$decoded = openssl_decrypt(
    $data,
    'DES-EDE3-CBC',
    $key,
    OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING,
    base64_decode(""cTOCJ/iYL18="")
);

echo ""\$decoded = {$decoded}"";

// Will output:
// $decoded = {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""events.enableParentGenres"",""params"":[159],""id"":1}

var md5sum = crypto.createHash('md5');
md5sum.update(new Buffer(str, 'binary'));
md5_result = md5sum.digest('hex');

Thanks in advance for your help!!!, Btw, my nodejs version is 10.1.0, and npm version is 5.6.0. And for the ones asking, this source code equivalent is not md5($str) and it is not my code, I'm just converting it. For example, for the following input 42b86318d761e13ef90c126c3e060582¤3¤724039¤1 the obtained digest is 9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596.
I just tried to run the following snippet at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_nodejs_online.php, taking into account your proposals but they don't work:
const crypto = require('crypto');
var str = ""42b86318d761e13ef90c126c3e060582¤3¤724039¤1"";
var md5sum = crypto.createHash('md5');
md5sum.update(new Buffer(str, 'binary'));
const md5_result = md5sum.digest('hex');
const md5 = crypto.createHash('md5').update(str).digest('hex');
const expected_digest = ""9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596"";
console.log(""original version digest:"" + md5_result);
console.log(""proposed equivalent digest:"" + md5);
console.log(""expected digest:"" + expected_digest);

What I get on that site is:
original version digest:9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596
proposed equivalent digest:b8ee918f782fe7135b25c1fa59339094
expected digest:9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596
Other sites such as https://www.katacoda.com/courses/nodejs/playground,https://repl.it/ ,https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-nodejs-online support my claim (i.e. md5 digest is 9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596), however,so far, this site http://rextester.com/l/nodejs_online_compiler outputs what some of you obtained(i.e. b8ee918f782fe7135b25c1fa59339094). As I said before, please, help me find a PHP EQUIVALENT version of the first nodejs snippet of code.
","You shouldn't use: new Buffer(str, 'binary') just:
const md5 = crypto
    .createHash('md5')
    .update(string)
    .digest('hex');

Using that, you will get the same output with php md5, linux md5sum, and node.
For your input: 42b86318d761e13ef90c126c3e060582¤3¤724039¤1 the following commands will print the same:
md5sum
echo -n ""42b86318d761e13ef90c126c3e060582¤3¤724039¤1"" | md5sum

PHP
echo md5(""42b86318d761e13ef90c126c3e060582¤3¤724039¤1"");

Node
require('crypto')
        .createHash('md5')
        .update(""42b86318d761e13ef90c126c3e060582¤3¤724039¤1"")
        .digest('hex');

All three will output: b8ee918f782fe7135b25c1fa59339094
NOTE:
new Buffer is deprecated, Buffer.from should be used instead.

Other sites such as
  https://www.katacoda.com/courses/nodejs/playground,https://repl.it/
  ,https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-nodejs-online support my claim (i.e.
  md5 digest is 9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596)

They're not supporting your claim, you're executing the same code, which is wrong, on many different node.js environment. Of course every Node.js environment will print that output for your code, that doesn't make it right.

Since you can't modify the code, and you want the PHP equivalent, here it is:
function utf8_char_code_at($str, $index) {
    $char = mb_substr($str, $index, 1, 'UTF-8');

    if (mb_check_encoding($char, 'UTF-8')) {
        $ret = mb_convert_encoding($char, 'UTF-32BE', 'UTF-8');
        return hexdec(bin2hex($ret));
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}

function myMD5($str) {

     $tmp = """";

     for($i = 0; $i < mb_strlen($str); $i++)
        $tmp .= bin2hex(chr(utf8_char_code_at($str, $i)));

     return md5(hex2bin($tmp));
}

echo myMD5($string);

utf8_char_code_at taken from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18499265/1119863
It will output: 9860bd2248c069c7b65045917c215596 same as your node snippet.

any idea what's causing all this?
","There are some cases in which NPM fails to find a file. Try the following and let me know:

Run the command vagrant halt to halt the vagrant
Delete the node_modules folder.
Update the NPM and Node to the latest version
Run npm cache clean --force
Now try to install
Once everything is done, you can up the vagrant by running vagrant up and if you wanted SSH, then run this command after up, vagrant ssh

More information related to the similar issues can be seen here
Might be useful for you, https://stackoverflow.com/a/47091934/2520628

Sadly, CryptoJS expect the salt as a String, and String in JS handle poorly binary data.
A char over 128 is interpreted as 2 bits in JS (see: Trouble with binary string in javascript above character code 128):
// if you wanna test it, openssl command to generate a file from any file :
// openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out file.enc -k password
fs.readFile('file.enc', function(err, data) {
    var Salted__ = data.toString(""utf-8"", 0, 8); // 'Salted__' prefix
    var salt = data.toString(""hex"", 8, 16); // the actual salt I want to give to CryptoJS
    // output in hex: 46d69efb7f57380b

    var buf = new Buffer(salt, ""hex"");
    console.log(buf);
    // output <Buffer 46 d6 9e fb 7f 57 38 0b>, exactly what I want, but it is a buffer not a String object.

    // the problem can be seen here:
    var buf2 = new Buffer(buf.toString());
    console.log(buf2);
    // output <Buffer 46 d6 9e ef bf bd 7f 57 38 0b>
    // as you can see, fb => ef bf bd

    // fun fact, when I try to do it manualy, I get another result (that seem more logical to me):
    var str = '';
    for (var i = 0; i < hex.length; i += 2)
        str += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex.substr(i, 2), 16));
    console.log(new Buffer(str));
    // output <Buffer 46 c3 96 c2 9e c3 bb 7f 57 38 0b>
    // in this case (I've tryed it char by char to be sure):
    // d6 => c3 96
    // 9e => c2 9e
    // fb => c3 bb

    var derivedParams = CryptoJS.kdf.OpenSSL.execute(password, 256/32, 128/32, buf.toString());
    console.log(derivedParams.key.toString());
    console.log(derivedParams.iv.toString());
    // output a wrong key and a wrong iv (I know what I should get using openssl enc -P option)

    var CORSPath = ""https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/"";
    var completeRestURL = CORSPath + baseRestURL + APIPath;

    request.setRequestHeader(""Accept"", ""application/json"");
    request.send(postData);

Follow up question: If not, is there a way to include encryption in our client side javascript that is safe? My thoughts was to use a webisite's public key to encrypt the request before sending it to the server but I can't find anyone else attempting client side encryption. 
Rough example:

var CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");
var stackOverflowKey = ""30 82 01 0a 02 82 01...""
var postData = ""{\""tokenId\"": \"""" + document.getElementById('api_key').value + ""\"",\""secret\"": \"""" + document.getElementById('secret').value + ""\"",\""loginMode\"": 1,\""applicationType\"": 35}"";
var encryptedPostData = cryptoJS.hmacSHA256(postData, stackOverflowKey)

//let's skip the callback and request headers as they are the same as above

var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open();
request.send(encryptedPostData);

I didn't study computer science and couldn't find anything online about this. What are the generally accepted ways of doing this?
","The HTTP in XMLHttpRequest, as is the XML part, is just a left over naming scheme. As the requests used can include more than just http protocol urls, and receive more than just an XML response body.
For instance the initial W3C working drafts introduced the XMLHttpRequest object by saying:

https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-XMLHttpRequest-20060927/#introduction
The name of the object is XMLHttpRequest for compatibility with the web
  as it doesn't make much sense otherwise. It supports the transport of
  other data formats in addition to XML, some implementations support
other protocols besides HTTP (that functionality is not covered in
  this specification though) and the API supports sending data as well.

Note the ""some implementations"" as this is a working draft back in 2006 so not everyone was using the same implementation.
The current whatwg spec for XMLHttpRequest has this to say about the name:

https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#introduction
The name XMLHttpRequest is historical and has no bearing on its
  functionality.

So as long as the browser being used implements the XMLHttpRequest according to specs, the request/response will be treated as it would normally by the browser, ie encrypted for https.

This will be for creating encryption of the password. Now to verify the password/signature again in NodeJS, you need to do the following:
var cipher = crypto.createDecipher('aes-256-ctr', config.secret);

This will give decrypted password/signature which you can compare easily. I hope it helps!

","Are you asking why you have to use a secret key for decryption? That's a trivial requirement for having an actually secure implementation for encryption. If your encrypted message could be decrypted WITHOUT using the secret key, then every single person on the planet earth can decrypt your message.

As you can see both signed string are the same. I have checked, there is no difference between two texts.
This is the code the I execute to generate the signature:
var accessKeyBytes = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(base64EncodedSharedKey);
var encodedBits = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(stringToSign, accessKeyBytes);
var result = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(encodedBits);
return result;

where base64EncodedSharedKey is the primary key of the Azure storage.
Do you have any ideas? What could I be doing wrong? Should I backslash the \n when forming the JavaScript string to be signed?
","Solved.
The problem is that at the end of the string to be signed I had put a \n.
I should have not put the return carriage at the end of the string.

","Here is a working jsfiddle:
https://jsfiddle.net/5Lr6z4zp/1/
The encryption results in a Base64 string, while the decrypted string is Hex. To get back the “Message” you need to convert that to Utf8: decryptedRequest.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)
Here is the relevant part of the code that works:
var request = ""testing decryption"";
var encryptedRequest = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(request, 'somekey');
console.log(encryptedRequest)  
var decryptedRequest = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedRequest, 'somekey');
var decryptedMessage = decryptedRequest.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)
console.log('Decrypted Request: ' + decryptedMessage);

The sha256 result appears to be the same but when I try to encode with base64 I get a different result. 
I have little to no javascript knowledge but from what I have found it may be something to do with .toString part converting from a word array and may be resulting in the string being base64 encoded in a different format.
I have tried a few different things converting to binary / hex strings and converting etc but still get the wrong result I'm sure if something stupid but can't quite figure it out any ideas ?

Since your reader is loading the file asynchronous, the second alert fires immediately after the other code. The reader is not done yet loading the file, so hash is empty.

Yes, but you don't just replace them with %.  Use this map:

"31159703","Adding CRC to packet somehow breaks CryptoJS's AES","I am writing a mobile app in javascript (with appcelerator) that communicates with a server app written in Java. 
The communication is encrypted. 
Now I want to implement integrity checking via CRC on the client (the server side is finished already by another party). 
While the CRC gets computed correctly, something seems to break the encryption process. It's very strange behaviour and I just can't seem to wrap my head around it.
The server uses bouncycastles for decryption.
The client sends javascript objects to the server in the following way:

The object gets converted to a json string
This then gets converted to a byteArray (Titanium.Buffer to be precise) - I'll call this: content
A header gets added with the following information: 


5 Bytes specify the packet type 
4 bytes for the length of the content
4 bytes for a CRC32 of the header
4 bytes for a CRC32 of the content

the content gets appended to the header - I'll call this: packet
the packet gets encrypted via cryptoJS AES in CBC mode
the encrypted packet gets a header (via the same method as the one before)
this gets sent to the server

The server then throws an exception:
bsc.sdk.security.bouncycastle.crypto.InvalidCipherTextException: pad block corrupted
at bsc.sdk.security.bouncycastle.crypto.paddings.PKCS7Padding.padCount(PKCS7Padding.java:62)
at bsc.sdk.security.bouncycastle.crypto.paddings.PaddedBufferedBlockCipher.doFinal(PaddedBufferedBlockCipher.java:273)
at bsc.sdk.api.crypt.aes.AESCipher.doFinal(AESCipher.java:60)
at bsc.sdk.api.crypt.aes.AESCipher.decrypt(AESCipher.java:36)

Now here's where the fun part starts: The exception only happens when the header CRC lies in a certain range. 
I tested this by manually writing integers around the original CRC into the header block. It fails when the integer is somewhere around the range between 1963000000 and 1963990000. These numbers are probably not exactly accurate but I didn't test further due to time constraints.
When I write some other Int like for example 2534528925 into the block, everything's fine.
So, does anyone have an idea why certain CRCs seem to break the padding of the AES algorithm?
Here are relevant code snippets of the client (if you need more, just ask):

    var commandString = JSON.stringify(command, null);

The first idea was to simply send variables to the server with get 
http://192.168.1.100:8080/var=hello

It's simple and works, but we must add a security level to the data exchange, encrypting all in Aes and then hexing the result to send it as plain string.
The best solution that we found is Crypto-JS https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/
We are able to follow the examples and encrypting/decrypting data inside the same js block, but are unable to decrypt the data on another software.
we do:
var text = ""Message"";
var password = ""Secret Passphrase"";

var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, password);

var EnText = encrypted.ciphertext; //returns the hexed/encrypted text
var Key = encrypted.key;

It doesn't work with the c# code running on the server, so we tried an online decrypting tool http://aes.online-domain-tools.com/ passing both the password and the Key, but similarly returns unreadable text
JS generated value for reference
EnText: 5768c9b4d75e0cc32b610d9e6f518c36

in the following way:
CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""Message"", ""SampleKey123456"")
From the documentation: 

For the key, when you pass a string, it's treated as a passphrase and used to derive an actual key and IV.

The Java Server is using JDK8 + JCE 
Questions: 

Will the IV be prepended to the Encrypted String (first 16 Bytes)? I guess not, because it says: derive an actual key and IV
How can I use the same Key Expansion in Java or which algorithm is it?I've got the Passphrase ""SampleKey123456"" as Plain Text and would use new SecretKeySpec(keyPlain.getBytes(), ""AES"") if it was the actual key instead of Passphrase
Another Idea would be using a standard Key Expansion/Derivation function like pbkdf, which could easily be used in cryptoJs and Java. 

","If anyone is interested in a spring-security-crypto compatible Version:
http://jsfiddle.net/robertwiesner/14Lhapv0/
It uses PBKDF2 with Password and Salt
var password = $(""[name='password']"").val();
var salt = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse($(""[name='salt']"").val());
var key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(password, salt, {
keySize: 256 / 32,
iterations: 1024
});

In Spring: return Encryptors.standard(cryptoPassword, new 
    String(Hex.encode(Utf8.encode(cryptoKeySalt)))); where cryptoPassword and cryptoKeySalt are regular String properties.

","CryptoJS assumes that

a key which is passed as a string is actually a password and will hash it again along with a randomly generated salt or it will use the key as-is if it is a WordArray and
the IV should be a WordArray

WordArray is CryptoJS' internal binary data representation.
The code should be:
try {
    var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""3f4c57006f7d2d9528de3c46b626df06cdc405cb0243b10ca7612d967c688744"");
    var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(""31fd1ae51454cd55db81f1fa60a343ed44"");
    var encText = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(encData, key, {
        iv: iv,
        mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC,
        padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
    }).ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64); 
    alert (""encText => ""+encText);    
    kony.print(""$$$$ encText => ""+encText);    
} 
catch (e) 
{
    alert(kony.i18n.getLocalizedString(""technicalError""));
}


Something to think about:

If you send the symmetric key from the server to the client, then anyone who might be listening will get the key and can decrypt the ciphertexts you send. This solution doesn't provide security, but rather obfuscation. You should use TLS which would make the connection actually secure.
The IV must be unpredictable (read: random). Don't use a static IV, because that makes the cipher deterministic and therefore not semantically secure. An attacker who observes ciphertexts can determine when the same message prefix was sent before. The IV is not secret, so you can send it along with the ciphertext. Usually, it is simply prepended to the ciphertext and sliced off before decryption.
It is better to authenticate your ciphertexts so that attacks like a padding oracle attack are not possible. This can be done with authenticated modes like GCM or EAX, or with an encrypt-then-MAC scheme.

""When passing a passphrase CrptyoJS generates a 256Bit key"": Which hashing algorithm it uses? If it's SHA I don't need to do it by hand.
This chapter says: ""when passing a WordArray as Key ... you must also pass the actual IV."" Because of using CryptoJS.SHA256 I'm going to pass a WordArray into it. Does it mean I need to parse the IV myself?

const key = ""315a5504d921f8327f73a356d2bbcbf1"";

But not working, any idea how to make this work?
","The IV should be random and the same IV needs to be used in both the encryption and decryption process.  
Your initialization vector is based on the unecrypted string, which is a very bad idea as you'd be leaking part of your unecrypted data if you send the IV with the encrypted data.

"45590205","Different outputs from Crypt(3) and CryptoJS","I am hashing passwords in MariaDB using:
ENCRYPT('password', CONCAT('$6$', SUBSTRING(SHA(RAND()), -16))
Which produces something like:
$6$3b502db443d64283$BNSYWsf3T0e4xT23GJW/QPpKvzLidio5zk9v7kCE.wk4dtNo4avMzBxvqoWc0Y5ihj/zVwtGCwZRfTFur0BnI1
The format here is $6 meaning SHA512, then the $salt$ and then the computed password hash. So the computed hash alone is 
BNSYWsf3T0e4xT23GJW/QPpKvzLidio5zk9v7kCE.wk4dtNo4avMzBxvqoWc0Y5ihj/zVwtGCwZRfTFur0BnI1
As I understand it this uses crypt(3) in the background. If I write a short bit of C such as:
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <crypt.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char * blah = crypt(""password"", ""$6$3b502db443d64283"");
  puts(blah);
}

Taking care to put in the same random salt as the RAND() function generated for MySQL and prepending the $6 to use SHA512, then I do indeed get the same result:
$6$3b502db443d64283$BNSYWsf3T0e4xT23GJW/QPpKvzLidio5zk9v7kCE.wk4dtNo4avMzBxvqoWc0Y5ihj/zVwtGCwZRfTFur0BnI1
Again the computed hash itself is:
BNSYWsf3T0e4xT23GJW/QPpKvzLidio5zk9v7kCE.wk4dtNo4avMzBxvqoWc0Y5ihj/zVwtGCwZRfTFur0BnI1
Now if I use CryptoJS and wanted to compare that Hash in JS code rather than in the DB (or in - heaven forfend! - C), then I find that I have a problem. For example here is my CryptoJS code:
var CryptoJS = require('crypto-js');
var SHA512 = require('crypto-js/sha512');
  console.log(SHA512(""3b502db443d64283password"")).toString();

I prepend the salt to the password as this function takes only a single argument. The result is:
105865ba5bf0649410927131204a1228260e59e95b1b53942001b98835dca4aedfe7039a00060fdba8531c44c83cd3b7bec4864865915938d2ed7ed477254f61
Ok. So I recognise that that is a Hex encoding of the Hashed password. So I'll change the encoding...but to what? I'll try Base64:
  `console.log(SHA512(""3b502db443d64283password"")).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);`

The output is:
EFhlulvwZJQQknExIEoSKCYOWelbG1OUIAG5iDXcpK7f5wOaAAYP26hTHETIPNO3vsSGSGWRWTjS7X7UdyVPYQ==
I'm starting to see a problem here. The encoding used by crypt(3) isn't base64. What is it? I look in the man page:

The characters in ""salt"" and ""encrypted"" are drawn from the set
  [a-zA-Z0-9./].

So I'm left with these questions:

What is the encoding used by crypt(3)? Is it a standard or just a chosen character set.
Is there any way to compare hashes generated with two different character sets like this? I mean is there an underlying representation they share of the hashed password? Can I access it?
How do I know how many rounds each function is making? Is there any way to know without examining the source code?
Is my assumption that I prepend the salt correct when using CryptoJS?

And given that encryption is AES256/CBC/PKCS7.
We can make these observations:

The string looks URL-encoded and Base64-encoded (%3D is =, and Base64 often ends with =)
There is no IV which is required for CBC, so it is probably in the first 16 bytes of the encoded string. The remainder of the string is probably the ciphertext

So we can decrypt it with CryptoJS like this:
var encrypted = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(decodeURIComponent(encryptedStr));
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(hexKey);
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.stringify(encrypted).substr(0, 32));
var ciphertext = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.stringify(encrypted).substr(32));

The key is generated correctly in back and front.
But the openssl_decrypt function return false and with openssl_error_string() get this:
error:0606506D:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:wrong final block length

I do not know what I'm doing wrong.

"46535172","Jquery validate - replace field values before serializing","Using the Jquery validate plugin I want to be able to use CryptoJS to obfuscate the fields password and confirm_password before I send the post data to the server.
The following methodology works fine, as in, the values for the two fields get replaced by the CryptoJS hash(?) and then get sent to the server. However, at the same time the password fields (the ones the users can see on the page) get populated with the hash as a bunch of additional asterisks. So if the users password was 123, then the visible fields change to the hash equivalent of that. This is not reflected in Chromes dev tools when viewing the input values (weird). How can I avoid this?

Unfortunately, I've run into a problem decrypting any messages that is encrypted using ""NoPadding"" padding. After hours and hours of testing the program for bugs, I finally found out what the problem was. I turns out that, when I append the encrypted javascript string into the HTML textarea, it changed the value of the string. Therefore, when I tried to decrypt the value from the textarea, it didn't work.
    <textarea id=""textarea""></textarea>

        var msg = decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
        alert(msg);

","There's something wrong with your key file I guess?
Your code works fine.
Here's an example of generating the signature in node:
var crypto = require('crypto');
var fs = require('fs');

var privateKey = fs.readFileSync('./junk').toString('utf8');
var publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./junk.pem').toString('utf8');

var sign = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256');
sign.update(""Test123"");
var sig = sign.sign(privateKey);
var bytes = Array.prototype.slice.call(sig, 0);
console.log(JSON.stringify(bytes));

var verify = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA256');
verify.update(""Test123"");
var success = verify.verify(publicKey, new Buffer(sig));

console.log(""Did sign? "" + success);

and here's an example of verifying it using bouncy castle in C# .net core (I've simplified, but its basically exactly what you're doing):

Either something is wrong with your public key, or the json input you're passing in to the function on both sides isn't quite the same for some reason.
There's nothing wrong with your signing code as far as I can tell.

I can only modify the Javascript code and I need a way to encrypt a string so that it can be decrypted by PHP's openssl_decrypt. It works fine obviously if the string it's encrypted from PHP.
I understand that by not declaring a IV renders the code less secure, but in my particular case it's not a big issue.
I've read in other topics that PHP defaults the padding to Pkcs7, which is why I added it to the JS method.
My current theory is that either the default IV of PHP is the issue or the output of the JS function needs to be further processed. As you can see I tried the Base64.stringify method, but the results are still different.
The sample key I'm using here is of the same length of the actual key.
I'm using https://github.com/sytelus/CryptoJS/blob/master/rollups/aes.js (whatever I use in JS, it needs to be easily distributed like a standalone file, with a relatively small footprint)
","There are some issues with your code:

If you want to use an existing key, then you need to provide a WordArray object to CryptoJS.<cipher>.encrypt. That means it has to be parsed in some way. If you simply provide a string as a ""key"", then CryptoJS will assume that it is a password, generate a random salt and use EVP_BytesToKey to derive the key and IV from password and salt.
Your ""key"" is 29 characters long. AES only supports three key sizes: 16, 24 and 32 bytes. Since you've used AES-128 in PHP, you need to provide a 16 byte key in CryptoJS so that AES-128 is automatically selected. Remember: a key is supposed to be randomly chosen and be indistinguishable from random noise so that it has some kind of security. If you must print the key in some way, use Hex or Base64 encoding.

Full example:


var iv  = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse("""");
var key = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"");
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""test"", key, {
    iv: iv, 
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, 
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
});

console.log(CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(encrypted.ciphertext));

So first you need to parse String from Hex i.e ->
68656c6c6f -> hello

and then calculate the sha256 hash :->
hello -> 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824

I googled it and found a lot of very different topics with long lines of code all the time, I don't know why.
Isn't it possible to store a password with one line of code with crypto.js ?
e.g. 
var crypto = require('crypto-js')  
collection.insert(user: ""my user"", password: crypto.sha2(""my-password"")

So later, I can do the simplest auth ever and process the result of this db request: 
db.findOne({use:""my user"", password: crypto.sha2(""my-password"") etc...

"36980835","Matching Signed Headers Encrypted in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript","I am using ApiAuth gem (as found here) to sign my request. I am also writing my own JavaScript code using CryptoJS (as found here) to provide authentication by checking the encrypted header generated by ApiAuth against the one generated by my code.
Given below is a code snippet from ApiAuth Gem:
def hmac_signature(headers, secret_key, options)
  if options[:with_http_method]
    canonical_string = headers.canonical_string_with_http_method(options[:override_http_method])
  else
    canonical_string = headers.canonical_string
  end
  digest = OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha1')
  b64_encode(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(digest, secret_key, canonical_string))
end

Here is the code I have written as an equivalent in JavaScript:
function hmacSignature(request, appSecret) {
 return CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(canonicalString(request), appSecret).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);}

These two don't generate the same encrypted header. I tried using jsSHA to do the same thing and while the encrypted header generated by jsSHA and CryptoJS is the same, they don't match the one generated by ApiAuth.
Kindly help me figure out how to make this work.
EDIT:
Taking Canonical String as ""message"" and appSecret as ""secret"" I get the same values from ApiAuth and CryptoJS which is:
DK9kn+7klT2Hv5A6wRdsReAo3xY=
I've figured out that the problem in my original code is coming because the timestamp set in my JS code and the one set in the ApiAuth don't match.
","I fixed my problem and am writing this answer in  hopes that it helps someone else looking for a solution to this problem.

Let me start off by saying that the two encryptions should be the same whether they are encrypted in Ruby or JS or any other language.
It is important to check that every portion of the input sent to both places is exactly the same and completely identical.

When I checked my inputs to the JS file and the gem, I realised that for some reason the time-stamp (which I was setting in the JS file) wasn't getting sent correctly to the gem.
I debugged my code step by step and figured out where the mistake was. I am outlining some of the possible issues below:

I was setting the timestamp in my JS as follow
request.headers[""DATE""]

I realised that this wasn't getting set correctly so I had to change ""DATE"" to ""DATE1"" and accordingly change the rest of my code. This worked.

Second, the timestamp I was sending wasn't compatible with the HTTP GST type timestamp that was expected by the gem. This is another thing that you must keep in mind when sending the timestamp.

crypto.Decryptor = crypto.extend({processBlock:function(a,b){this._cipher.decryptBlock(a,b)}});

"19895493","Three-pass Protocol in CryptoJS and OpenSSL","I am looking to do a three-pass exchange with CryptoJS (client) and OpenSSL (server). I can not find any examples on how to do this, could any one pint me in the right directions. I am looking to do the following:

Server sends client a string encrypted with a randomly generated key.
Client encrypts the string with another key, and sends it back to the server
Server decrypts the string using server's key from step 1 and sends it back to the client
Client decrypts the string with client's key from step 2. Client now has original string from the server.

This is for a small app I am making. I have used CryptoJS before, but I never had to do the three-pass before, and an example to work from would be very helpful. Thank you for any help.

For some reason I don't know, time to time, the result of the encryption cause the CT to have spaces in the string. When there's space, the PHP helper cannot decrypt it. If I removed the spaces it doesn't decrypt either.
Here the JS snippet:
var my_encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(phrase), 'MYSALT', {format: CryptoJSAesJson}).toString();

"40841541","Promise.method() function not working the way I expect it to work","I am writing some code that encrypts a communication channel between two users.
The steps are as follows

Check if a cipher for the channel exists in mongoDb
If yes, fetch the cipher and encrypt the incoming data
If no, create a new cipher, save it to mongoDb and encrypt the incoming data

The code uses crypto module which is one of the few synchronous libs in core nodejs
Create a cipher and return it as a promise
cipher.createCipher = Promise.method((pw) => {
  if (!pw) {
    throw new Error('Passphrase must be provided');
  }
  return crypto.createCipher('aes192', pw);
});

Encrypt data using Promise.method()
cipher.encryptTextAsPromise = Promise.method((cipher, plainText) => {
  if (!( typeof plainText === 'string')) {
    throw new Error(""2nd param must be plain text"");
    let cipherText = '';
    cipher.on('readable', () => {
      var data = cipher.read();
      if (data)
        cipherText += data.toString('hex');
    });
    cipher.on('end', () => {
      return cipherText;
    });
    cipher.write(plainText);
    cipher.end();
  }
});

Encrypt data via callback functions.
cipher.encryptText = (cipher, plainText, callback) => {
  if (!( typeof plainText === 'string')) {
    throw new Error(""2nd param must be plain text"");
  }
  try {
    let cipherText = '';
    cipher.on('readable', () => {
      var data = cipher.read();
      if (data)
        cipherText += data.toString('hex');
    });
    cipher.on('end', () => {
      callback(null, cipherText);
    });
    cipher.write(plainText);
    cipher.end();
  } catch (e) {
    callback(e, null);
  }
}

I am unable to chain these two together. What I have is a horrible anti-pattern that is worse than getting stuck in callback hell
cipher.createCipher('secretWord')
  .then((data) => {
    cipher.encryptTextasPromise(data, 'hello world')
    .then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
    })
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  })

mongoDbSearch(username)
  .then((data) => {
    if (data) {
      // Cipher exists, retrieve and encrypt
    }else {
      // Create new cipher and save
      someMongoSave()
        .then((data) => {
          // Cipher exists now, retrieve and encrypt
        })
    }
  })
  .catch((mongoErr) => {
    console.log(mongoErr);
  })

The code is a bit incomplete as I am still trying to grasp this concept. Furthermore the my attempt to chain createCipher and encryptTextAsPromise is returning undefined in the data. I have tried writing these as normal callback and then using Promise.promisfyAll() as well, which just feels like another anti-pattern.
","Promise.method would appear to make sense for createCipher, but probably not for encryptTextAsPromise.
Here's a version that should point you the right direction, distilling various of T.J. Crowder's, Jaromanda X's, and undefined's comments on the question; see code comments for more:
// For this one, `Promise.method` still makes sense (although doing it with
// your own promise is also perfectly reasonable)
cipher.createCipher = Promise.method(pw => {
  if (!pw) {
    throw new Error('Passphrase must be provided');
  }
  return crypto.createCipher('aes192', pw);
});

// For this one, your own promise makes sense
cipher.encryptTextAsPromise = (cipher, plainText) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    if (!( typeof plainText === 'string')) {
      // It's fine to throw here (it will get converted into a rejection),
      // or add `reject` to the arguments list above and call
      // that and return instead:
      // reject(new Error(""2nd param must be plain text""));
      // return;
      throw new Error(""2nd param must be plain text"");
    }
    let cipherText = '';
    cipher.on('readable', () => {
      var data = cipher.read();
      if (data)
        cipherText += data.toString('hex');
    });
    cipher.on('end', () => {
      resolve(cipherText);
    });
    cipher.write(plainText);
    cipher.end();
  });
};

// Usage:
cipher.createCipher('secretWord')
.then(data => cipher.encryptTextAsPromise(data, 'hello world'))
.then(data => console.log(data)) // See 1 below
.catch(err => console.log(err));

mongoDbSearch(username)
.then(data => data || someMongoSave(data)) // You pass `data` to `someMongoSave`, presumably?
.then(data => {
    // Cipher exists, retrieve and encrypt
})
.catch(mongoErr => {
    console.log(mongoErr);
});

file_put_contents($courseOutlineFile, bin2hex($iv) . bin2hex($ciphertext));

And my Javascript code, where res is the text from the ajax response to read the file generated by PHP: 
var k = CryptoJS.MD5('super secret');
var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(res.substring(0, 32));
var data = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(res.substring(32));

console.log(""key: "", CryptoJS.enc.Hex.stringify(k))

});
console.log(""decrypted:"", dec.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex));

var json = dec.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
console.log(""json:"", json)

I've verified with a compare tool that the hex values of the key, IV, and data are the same in PHP and what gets printed to the browser's console.  It does successfully decrypt (something), but that last console.log statement generates an error: Error: ""Malformed UTF-8 data"".  If I try Latin1 it results in a bunch of non-printable characters.
The $message variable that I'm encrypting is the output from json_encode on an array.
Does anyone know what I'm missing?
These are the first 80 hex digits of the decrypted result, the entire thing is a little under 28k hex digits.

"56414023","How to rewrite NodeJS CryptoJS functions so they work in ReactJS web?","I have some code that was created for me by a past contractor that provided a working implementation of CryptoJS between a Unity3D client and NodeJS server app (as in encryption of client-server messages).
I am working on an implementation that needs to call the same server endpoints from a React web app. Basically, I need to be able to ensure that the React app provides the same results when encrypting and decrypting messages as the server (and hence the Unity3D implementation) does.
The existing encrypt/decrypt functions in the NodeJS app are shown below. They are somewhat more advanced than the standard CryptoJS examples and when I attempt to use them as-is in React, I get this error:
TypeError: cryptoJS.createHash is not a function. (In 'cryptoJS.createHash('md5')', 'cryptoJS.createHash' is undefined)
After some researching, I understand that potentially the 'use as-is' approach will fail because it's using a server side library on the client side, but I have been able to find anything that would explain how I would recreate the same code to work client-side.
encrypt(text, key, iv) {
    const keyBuffer = Buffer.from(cryptoJS.createHash('md5').update(key).digest('hex'), ""hex"")
    const ivBuffer = Buffer.from(cryptoJS.createHash('md5').update(iv).digest('hex'), ""hex"")
    const textBuffer = Buffer.from(text, 'utf8')
    let cipher = cryptoJS.createCipheriv(algorithm, keyBuffer, ivBuffer)
    let encryptedText = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(textBuffer), cipher.final()])
    return encryptedText.toString(""base64"")
}

decrypt(text, key, iv) {
    const keyBuffer = Buffer.from(cryptoJS.createHash('md5').update(key).digest('hex'), ""hex"")
    const ivBuffer = Buffer.from(cryptoJS.createHash('md5').update(iv).digest('hex'), ""hex"")
    let decipher = cryptoJS.createDecipheriv(algorithm, keyBuffer, ivBuffer)
    const textBuffer = Buffer.from(text, 'base64')
    var decipheredContent = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(textBuffer), decipher.final()])
    return decipheredContent.toString(""utf8"")
}

So, I need to figure out how to replace these encrypt/decrypt functions with ones that compile and function in client side in React web. Any help in steering me in the right direction or assisting with the code would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read my question.

        Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'outputLength' does not exist in type 'string | WordArray |

","That's because that function is defined, in @types/crypto-js, as:

As you see, it expects three parameters, the second being the key (which is nullable). Just do this:

By the way, there's another @types for this library, @types\cryptojs, it might suit you better.

","No, this is generally not secure.
First of all, you wrongly state your goal. AES encryption is not a goal, it is a means to an end. What you want to do is to keep your form data confidential. The form data is called ""the message"" in crypto terminology.
If you need to send your message to a server, and then let the server have the decrypted form, then you need transport security. It's best to use TLS for that. Commonly JavaScript doesn't have any means to create a trust relationship with the server (your browser uses it's certificate store with trusted certificates for that). So in that case you cannot rely on JavaScript security.
Sometimes you want to keep your front end from decrypting the messages. In that case you could send a public key such as an RSA public key over the secure channel. Then you could encrypt the form data using RSA and AES (hybrid cryptography). Your backend would then be able to decrypt the messages. This scheme still fails if your front end sends the wrong key though, as the message would be encrypted with a public key from another party. So this assumes that the front end software cannot be easily hacked (or replaced altogether by a different server, subverting the traffic).
Even if you could use a trusted AES key then using CBC for transport mode security will definitely enable plaintext or padding oracle attacks. You're lacking way too much experience with crypto to pull this off. Use TLS, that's hard enough (to secure, using it is relatively easy).

According to the post here, the Crypto-JS can decode the Java output successfully.
However, the java program cannot decode the javascript output sucessfully.
Here is my javascript progarm
    <script src=""js/cryptojs/rollups/aes.js""></script>
    <script src=""js/cryptojs/components/mode-ctr-min.js""></script>
    <script language=javascript>
          ..................
      var result;
      var encoded=CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""hello"",
                                       keyArray,
                                       {
                                         iv: ivArray,
                                         mode: CryptoJS.mode.CTR,
                                         padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
                                        });

      result=encoded.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
   </script>

My java program:
   byte iv[] = new byte[16];
   SecureRandom secRandom = new SecureRandom() ;
   secRandom.nextBytes(iv);       
   Cipher decipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CTR/PKCS5PADDING"");
   decipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, aesKey,new IvParameterSpec(iv)); 
   byte[] cipherTextInByteArr =Base64.getDecoder().decode(encodedText);
   byte[] plainTextInByteArr = decipher.doFinal(cipherTextInByteArr);     
   String result=new String(plainTextInByteArr,""UTF-8"");

However,the output is ""hello???????"". 
   Is there something wrong?
","Finally, I get it works.
According to this post, CTR mode does not require padding.
Therefore the javascript program look like:
<script src=""js/cryptojs/rollups/aes.js""></script>
<script src=""js/cryptojs/components/mode-ctr-min.js""></script>
<script language=javascript>
      ..................
  var result;
  var encoded=CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""hello"",
                                   keyArray,
                                   {
                                     iv: ivArray,
                                     mode: CryptoJS.mode.CTR,
                                     padding: CryptoJS.pad.NoPadding
                                    });

  result=encoded.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64);
</script>

And the java program look like:
byte iv[] = new byte[16];
SecureRandom secRandom = new SecureRandom() ;
secRandom.nextBytes(iv);       
Cipher decipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CTR/NoPadding"");
decipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, aesKey,new IvParameterSpec(iv)); 
byte[] cipherTextInByteArr =Base64.getDecoder().decode(encodedText);
byte[] plainTextInByteArr = decipher.doFinal(cipherTextInByteArr);     
String result=new String(plainTextInByteArr,""UTF-8"");

I think the problem is CryptoJS.AES.encrypt where I am not passing it the correct configuration?
Really stuck on this, so if you have any suggestions, I'd like to know.
","In both cases the key is not treated in the way you expect. 'a1cbbb6eb5cb2c1c27a9f02a4434d3af' is the hex representation of a 16 byte (= 128 bit) key, that can be used for AES128. 
mcrypt does not know its getting a hex representation and treats it as 32 byte string and - IIRC - throws away everything except its first 16 bytes ('a1cbbb6eb5cb2c1c'). You need to unhexlify the key to get the raw bytes: $key=pack('H*', 'a1cbbb6eb5cb2c1c27a9f02a4434d3af').
CryptoJS also does not know it's presented a hex representation of the key and treats it as password instead, which is used as input to PBKDF2. The library has its own unhexlify routines: var key = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse('a1cbbb6eb5cb2c1c27a9f02a4434d3af'); The resulting WordArray will be treated by CryptoJS as binary key input.

var iv = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(aesIV);

var encryptedString = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(input,key,{iv: iv});
console.log(encryptedString.ciphertext.toString().length);
encryptedString = encryptedString.ciphertext.toString();

Everything matches, including the string lenght before and after pkcs5_pad.  I'm using some additional JavaScript code from locutus.io to call str_repeat, and chr.  Here encryptedString.ciphertext.toString().length returns 160 characters and the first 128 match that of my PHP script.
My understanding is that version 3 of CryptoJS uses CBC mode, but I've also set the mode explicitly to CBC to no avail.  I've also returned the encrypted string as hex
encryptedString = encryptedString.ciphertext.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);

","The extra 32 characters are hex encoding of 16 bytes and that is the padding. The Java is adding padding, the PHP is not.
Note that mcrypt does not use standard PKCS#7 (née PKCS#5) padding.
Good encryption libraries will have a padding option and add the padding on encryption and remove it on decryption. You should not have to do your own padding.

var salt = (this.countryList.response.salt);

Here is my C# code for encrypting:
byte[] iv = new byte[16];

BufferedBlockCipher aes = new BufferedBlockCipher(new OfbBlockCipher(new AesEngine(), 16));
ParametersWithIV ivAndKey = new ParametersWithIV(new KeyParameter(stretchedKey), iv);
aes.Init(true, ivAndKey);

byte[] outBuf = new byte[minSize];
int length1 = aes.ProcessBytes(privateKey, 0, privateKey.Length, outBuf, 0);
int length2 = aes.DoFinal(outBuf, length1);

byte[] encryptedKey = iv.Concat(outBuf.Take(length1 + length2)).ToArray();

My Javascript code is the following for encrypting (try it on JSFiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/gCHAG/424/):
var key = Crypto.util.hexToBytes('59b50e345cab8b6d421b161918ea3fbd7e5921eea7d43d1ac54fa92cca452bb5');

var encrypted = Crypto.AES.encrypt(message, key, { iv: iv, asBytes: true, mode: new Crypto.mode.OFB(Crypto.pad.NoPadding) });

I get the following from the bouncy castle implementation: 578934dbb576dc986a531f09e8d5abd5b01dc1bfd3ededd222ff8aa6e4bfdbf2

Note how the first two bytes are the same, but then everything else is different.
To top it all up, when trying on an online tool, I get a third output (see http://aes.online-domain-tools.com/link/bd243g1VXbD7LUAS/): 57804D64A8...
I went through everything several times, but I don't see why I get different outputs.
","CryptoJS seems to use an output of 128 bits per block for the key stream. You specify 16 bits per block for Bouncy. As 8 or 128 bits per block are common for OFB, and since 128 is the recommended output size, I guess you are just confusing bits and bytes in the Bouncy code.
If you specify new OfbBlockCipher(new AesEngine(), 128) you should be OK.

As you can see I copied the answers to ""website - How to read a web page in PHP"", ""php - file_get_contents() failed to open stream"" & ""php - Why file_get_contents() returns ""failed to open stream: HTTP request failed!""?"", ""fsockopen - PHP connect to external ip with port"" and other optional solutions found here on StackOverflow as well as from SuperUser, PHP Freaks and others I found on the web.
(On a side note, since I don't have enough credits or something yet, SO don't allow me to post more than 2 links and so thanks to user bmla for de-uglifying this post)
My code is on an external host that I have no control over, but function_exists('curl_version') returns true, as well as ini_get('allow_url_fopen') does, however http_get gives an undefined function error. 
I have tried all functions on itself, as well as in combination with each other and with other techniques I found or could think of, among which is the redirection through Aaron Brown's proxy ($trythispathforachange = $proxy . $path;). Sadly, all functions and combinations I have tried result in either a ""connection failed"", or a ""connection timed out"" error and in the case of Snoopy it tells me that the tcp://-connection went sour. Also, for https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js everything works flawlessly, so I think the code must be correct so far.
But apparently for googlecode.com there still is something that prevents it from yielding a response to me in contrast to any human-interface-based browser.
Thanks in advance for any help or information provided!

"55190887","AES decryption with wrong key. how to hide the fact the key was wrong?","I'm using CryptoJS. when i use AES.decrypt with the wrong key, i noticed it usually has a negative ""sigBytes"", which tells me i used the wrong key. why is this possible? does it have something to do with invalid padding? I've tried different modes of AES, same issue. is it even possible for AES to not acknowledge failure?
is there a standard encryption algo that will decrypt to random bytes with no indication of success or failure?
","Yes,  stream based ciphers do generally never report failure. Basically, if you know that the ciphertext size is the same as the plaintext size then failure cannot be reported. This is because general purpose ciphers generally accept any message, meaning that there is exactly one ciphertext for each plaintext for a certain bit length and vice versa, independent on what key is used. Such a 1:1 mapping is called a pseudo random permutation or PRP. As each ciphertext leads back to a valid plaintext message, there is no error to return.
All stream ciphers (such as ChaCha) and block cipher streaming modes will therefore have this property. Streaming modes are modes that do not require padding and should therefore not expand the ciphertext size compared with the plaintext size. Of course, if you actively indicate that padding is required you may destroy this particular property. Currently the most common counter mode is probably CTR mode, also because it is used for almost all authenticated modes. CFB/OFB are generally considered for legacy purposes only.
Beware that an adversary may still get information depending on the information in the plaintext. Generally a key can be found even if very little plaintext is known (a JPEG header would for instance easily be sufficient knowledge). Other operations on wrong plaintext may also easily indicate failure (turning the receiving side into a so called plaintext oracle).

Clearly they are very close, but node seems to be padding the output with some extra bytes. Any ideas how I can get the two to interoperate?
","First, in a secure crypto system, you should expect the output to be different every time you encrypt, even using the same code. That fact that yours doesn't indicates it's an insecure cipher. Typically this is done by adding a random IV.
Your IV is ""11869021012"", which is horrible (because it's not random, and not even 16 bytes), but it does seem you're using it the same way in both, so that's fine.
Your password is the SHA-256 of a string, which is a horrible way to create a key, but still, you seem to be doing it the same way in both cases, so that's fine.
Your problem is that the Python code emits the IV followed by the cipher text. Your JS code does not emit the IV; it only emits the cipher text. So you probably meant this in the Python:
return base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(cleartext))

Or you need to rework the JavaScript to glue together the IV and the cipher text before Base64 encoding.

","Ciphertext refers to the encrypted text.
As for the error you're getting: there's an encoding error in your code (and in the article you've copied it from).
This line:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({&quot;ciphertext&quot;:encrypted_data}, key128Bits500Iterations, options);

Should be:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({""ciphertext"":encrypted_data}, key128Bits500Iterations, options);

Or even just:
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt({ciphertext:encrypted_data}, key128Bits500Iterations, options);

The JSFiddle that the article links to has the correct code.

I basically generated it via 
crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
    modulusLength: 4096,
    publicKeyEncoding: {
      type: 'spki',
      format: 'pem'
    },
    privateKeyEncoding: {
      type: 'pkcs8',
      format: 'pem',
      cipher: 'aes-256-cbc',
      passphrase: ''
    }
  });

When I check more in internet I saw an example at enter link description here
that the header of the private key is ""-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"" and actually I could run that code in Ubuntu and no error happens. So  it looks the problem is related to the header that change due to 'pkcs8' type inside privateKeyEncoding. 
Also I noticed that my node version on windows is 10.15.3 and on ubuntu is 12.4
Could it be also related to the node version change?
","I've tried something very similar on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04. In my case I generate public / private key files, encrypt then decrypt using these. It's working well on both platforms. It's worth giving this a go to see if it works for you. Node versions are: Windows: 10.15 Ubuntu 10.16.
const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require(""fs"");

function generateKeyFiles() {

    const keyPair = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
        modulusLength: 4096,
        publicKeyEncoding: {
            type: 'spki',
            format: 'pem'
        },
        privateKeyEncoding: {
        type: 'pkcs8',
        format: 'pem',
        cipher: 'aes-256-cbc',
        passphrase: ''
        }
    });

    fs.writeFileSync(""public_key"", keyPair.publicKey);
    fs.writeFileSync(""private_key"", keyPair.privateKey);
}

// Encrypt a string given a public key file. Encode the result in base64.
function encryptString (plaintext, publicKeyFile) {
    const publicKey = fs.readFileSync(publicKeyFile, ""utf8"");
    const encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, Buffer.from(plaintext));
    return encrypted.toString(""base64"");
}

// Encrypt a string given a cipherText (in base64) and a private key file.
function decryptString (ciphertext, privateKeyFile) {
    const privateKey = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyFile, ""utf8"");
    const decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(privateKey, Buffer.from(ciphertext, ""base64""));
    return decrypted.toString(""utf8"");
}

generateKeyFiles();

const plainText = ""I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."";

const cipherText = encryptString(plainText, ""./public_key"");

console.log();
console.log(""Plaintext:"", plainText);
console.log();
console.log(""Ciphertext: "", cipherText);
console.log();
console.log(""Decrypted Text: "", decryptString(cipherText, ""private_key""));
console.log();

You could also try copying the key files from Windows to Ubuntu (skipping the generate key files step). This is working for me too.

","I don't know Java, but your usage looks somewhat weak, there are algorithms like PBKDF2 (which is old and discouraged now) and scrypt which do a much better job at turning human passwords into keying material.  I'm also not sure where your IV is coming from in your Java code.  Exactly replicating the Java code would be somewhat difficult as you'd need to know how your version of Java was implemented, and hence how the bytes passed to setSeed actually get turned into a key.
Node's Crypto module, as far as I can tell, assumes you know how long the keys are supposed to be.  In the case of AES 128 in CBC mode, this would be 128 bits (i.e. 16 bytes) for both the key and IV.
Assuming you wanted to use things built into the Crypto module (argon2 would be recommended if you could relax this restriction) then you'd do something like:
const crypto = require('crypto');

const password = 'passw0rd';

const scrypt_salt = crypto.randomBytes(16);
const key = crypto.scryptSync(password, scrypt_salt, 16);

which would leave you with a suitable value in key, then you'd encrypt with:
const plaintext = 'the plain text to encode';

const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-128-cbc', key, iv);

const ciphertext = Buffer.concat([
    cipher.update(plaintext),
    cipher.final(),
]);

and you could encode to Base64 with ciphertext.toString('base64').
Note that to be able to decrypt this, you'd need the scrypt_salt, iv, and ciphertext.

","When you encrypt something using AES, there is always a ""mode"" in play. In your Java code you don't specify a mode explicitly - Cipher.getInstance(""AES""). When you do not specify a mode, the default mode in Java is ""ECB"" which is the most insecured mode anyway.
In your NodeJs code, you're using ""CBC"" mode which is a altogether different mode.
Neither ""ECB"", nor ""CBC"" are considered secured enough. As of today, usually, the recommended mode is the GCM mode.
To generate a key from a password, ideally a ""key derivation function"" should be used. The 4 key derivation functions recommended by OWASP are: PBKDF2, Scrypt, Bcrypt and Argon2.
In your Java code, the password is used as a seed for the pseudo random number generator class SecureRandom. That's a little bit bizarre because even if you give the same password to your function, it will produce different key in different run. Yes, SecureRandom is also used to generate key. But if the requirement is to generate a key from a password, a key derivation function, as mentioned above, shoul be used. Both the approaches are shown in the following StackOverflow answer with detailed explanation. However, it uses ""GCM"" mode. But as long as you understand the concepts, you can use any mode of your choice.

"46522618","Node 6 upgrade caused SignatureDoesNotMatch errors from aws-sdk because of crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING='binary'","I have moved from node 4 to node 6 and this caused anything using the aws-sdk to return the following error message:

SignatureDoesNotMatch: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details.

Looking into the code this seems to be caused by my code calling crypto to create and validate hashes and sets
 crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING = 'binary' 

If I change this from 'binary' to 'buffer' (which is the default) the aws-sdk works but my code cannot validate old hashes.
This is the code used to create and check the hashes:
  crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keysize, function (err, derivedKey) {
      callback(null, [salt.toString('base64'), new Buffer(derivedKey).toString('base64')])
  });

Looking at the crypto documentation for crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING I am not sure what the difference is between using buffer and binary.
Is there a way to use the binary encoding only for this crypto method and not affect the aws-sdk ?
If not is there a way of transforming a hash produced by pbkdf2 using 'buffer' encoding to what it would have produced if it was using the 'binary' encoding? 
","Looking at the crypto.pbkdf2 source code found here. The DEFAULT_ENCODING variable is only used if it is not set to ""buffer"" (which is the default). If it is set to some other encoding this piece of code gets executed to change the result to the desired encoding:
 // at this point, we need to handle encodings.
if (callback) {
  function next(er, ret) {
    if (ret)
      ret = ret.toString(encoding);
    callback(er, ret);
  }
  PBKDF2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest, next);
} else {
  var ret = PBKDF2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest);
  return ret.toString(encoding);
}

So if you remove the DEFAULT_ENCODING or set it to ""buffer"" and then use result.toString(""binary"") on the result of the pbkdf2 function you should get the exact same result as if you were using DEFAULT_ENCODING=""binary"" as demonstrated by the following example:
var crypto = require(""crypto"");

function defaultBuffer(){
    crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING = ""buffer"";
    crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, 5, 12, function (err, derivedKey) {
        console.log(""Key (Buffer + toString('binary')): ""+ derivedKey.toString('binary'))
      });

}
function defaultBinary(){
    crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING = ""binary"";
    crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, 5, 12, function (err, derivedKey) {
        console.log(""Key (binary): ""+ derivedKey)
      });
}
var password = 'password';
var salt = 'salt';
defaultBuffer();
defaultBinary();

This produces the following result:

Key (Buffer + toString('binary')): ®?åõp~óçÁ

"55173662","Passport fails authentication with ""Wrong password"" before actually calling my passwordMatch function","This is a weird one.
What im trying to do
Create an authentication server in node.js using Passportjs local strategy, and JWT. Allowing for account registration with email & password, with passwords hashed with 'crypto'
What's happening
So when I login with the right password, to a pre existing model, authentication fails in the APi for having a wrong password. Though theres some weird stuff going on.
What I've tried
Essentially when I make the post request:

OPTIONS /api/login calls
It goes through my passport config, and in the typical function where you check if the password is correct
side note: POST api/login is logged to the console

The function in my passport config:
if (!profileController.passMatch(username, password)) {
            console.log('pass was wrong');
            return done(null, false, {
                message: 'Password is wrong'
            });
        }


The 'pass was wrong' thing calls, failing the authentication with done(). Though in passMatch, as you'll see below, it does show the correct password

passMatch function in profile controller:
module.exports.passMatch = (email, password) => {
    User.findOne({email: email}, (err, user) => {
        if (err) { console.log (""error at passMatch: "" + err); }
        var hash = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, user.salt, 1000, 64, 'sha512').toString('hex');
        console.log(user.hash == hash);
        return (user.hash == hash);
    });
    return false;
};


Though if you notice the console log where I check if the hash comparison is correct. That log statement is printed to the console after 'pass was wrong' is logged. It's also printed after the passport.authenticate call in my login function concludes a failed authentication at the console.log(info)

Login function:
module.exports.login = (req, res) => {

    console.log('beginning to authenticate');

    passport.authenticate('local', (err, user, info) => {

        console.log (""authenticating"");
        var token;

        // If passport throws an error
        if (err) {
            res.status(404).json(err);
            console.log(""error logging in"");
            return;
        }

        // If a user is found
        if (user) {

            // Respond with JWT
            token = createJwt(user)
            res.status(200);
            res.json({
                ""token"": token
            })
            console.log(""user logged in"");

        // If a user wasn't found
        } else {

            res.status(401).json(info);
            console.log(info);
        }

    })(req, res);

};


Error logging in isn't called, but the console.log(info) is called with the error message from the done() message in the config.

What's going wrong here?
","In the ""passMatch"" function, I query for the user again (which is just inefficient), but since this operation was asynch, it was being skipped to the ""return false"" statement after, and in the passport authentication config process, it recieved that false, causing authentication to fail, but the ""log"" to be returned after cause it took longer.
How I fixed it
I passed in the user object that passport already queried instead of the username into passMatch, then had two operations to check if the hash was the same and returned that, and now it works.
The new code
module.exports.passMatch = (user, password) => {
    var hash = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, user.salt, 1000, 64, 'sha512').toString('hex');
    return user.hash == hash;
};

Also the necessary change in the passport config to pass in the user instead of the username as the first param to that function.

Fiddle update : https://jsfiddle.net/n6wL9a40/
","First, actually CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(encryptedText) doesn't give you back a Base64 string, but an object, you should use it with toString like this: CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(encryptedText).toString() to get back your original string that was encoded in Base64
But the real problem is that you use the wrong part of the encrypted object (see linked fiddle, trying to decrypt .ciphertext won't work, because ciphertext is just the last part of the encrypted result needed for decryption, first part is missing). And additionally, there is no need to convert your output to Base64 at all, because it's already in Base64!
console.log(encrypted.toString()); //will already be Base64
See all this in an updated fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/gqkcvjxo/
EDIT:
For your other question I quote the docs: 

CryptoJS supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key

You can generate a key for AES-128 by using a pass of length 16 (128/8), you'll see in the fiddle that it works, the encrypted text length is halved.
var pass = 'abcdefghijklmnop'; //must be length 16 (because 128/8)
var key =  CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(pass);

Updated fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/o3975jtd/3/
To answer your other question, the encrypted text is not the same each time in first version because of the generated iv (see explanation here). By using a key with AES-128 in ECB mode, the iv is not automatically generated and comes undefined (apparently, when trying to specify one, nothing changes, probably because it's not used as told in the explanation link)

","You didn't specify what different results are you getting but those two should produce same-ish result. The only difference I see is in the base64 alphabet you're using.
In Python you're calling base64.urlsafe_b64encode() which differs from the standard Base64 in what characters it uses for values for 62 and 63 (- and _ instead of + and /). To get the same result, either in Python return:
return base64.b64encode(encrypted)

Or post-process the base64 encoded string in Node.js:
encoded = encoded.replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/-/g, '+');

All this being said, as I've mentioned in my comment, never derive an IV from your password/key (or anything else deterministic and unchanging). Use a cryptographically secure PRNG for it.

"52069243","Is there a SHA that's guaranteed to produce a unique hash?","I am looking for a way to hash a user id, obtained from a 3rd party service, such that I can use the hash as a primary key.
My understanding is that the usual SHA-512 style algorithms, given an input string that is guaranteed to be unique, are not guaranteed to produce a hash value that is also guaranteed to be unique.
Is there a hashing algorithm that will produce an unique hash?
More specifically is there such an algorithm supported out of the box by NodeJS 10.9 or better
","Most hashing algorithms are doing their best to avoid collisions. SHA 512 ought to be fine for you, if not SHA 256. Note that if you can see collisions in the input data, there will be collisions in the hashes, in which case I recommend appending something else likely unique to two separate accounts - such as the timestamp they were created - before inputting the value into the hash. This will work just fine so long as both inputs are immutable and they never change on the account. 
You can use crypto.getHashes() to view available hashes and pick the one you want. You are asking after uniqueness and not security so faster is better.
This answer is also related:
When using SHA-256 hashes as a primary key, is it OK to ignore the possibility of collisions?

","Length of a SHA-512 hash is 64 bytes(512 bits) long which gives you 10154 combinations of values. So it has a very less (i mean a very very less ) chance of getting same hash. 
How much very less it is, think of the weight of the sun from grams (which is weigh million times like the earch). If any other planet weight 10154 of grams, not even a millions of millions suns combined can be equals to that amount.
So by very less, it means never. Even the bitcoin addresses are using this method as the wallet address. If you by any chance can find that one combination, you will be a billionaire. I promise

Thank you for your help.
","There are two flaws in the JavaScript-code that can be corrected as follows:

In the JavaScript-code the line: 
var cipherText = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(encrypted);

must be replaced by:
var cipherText = byteArrayToWordArray(encrypted); 

Here, the function byteArrayToWordArray is used:
function byteArrayToWordArray(ba) {
    var wa = [], i;
    for (i = 0; i < ba.length; i++) 
        wa[(i / 4) | 0] |= ba[i] << (24 - 8 * i);
    return CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(wa, ba.length);
}

This function generates a word-array from the byte-array by generating a word (4 bytes) from 4 bytes of the byte-array. In the old code, a word of the same value is generated for each byte, i.e. both arrays have the same number of elements, which is wrong.
Alternatively: 
var cipherTextHex = bytesToHex(encrypted);
var cipherText = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(cipherTextHex);

can also be used. Here, the function bytesToHex is used:
function bytesToHex(bytes) {
    for (var hex = [], i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++) {
        var current = bytes[i] < 0 ? bytes[i] + 256 : bytes[i];
        hex.push((current >>> 4).toString(16));
        hex.push((current & 0xF).toString(16));
    }
    return hex.join("""");
}

The function generates a hex-string from the byte-array. From this a word-array is derived using the appropriate encoder.
In the JavaScript-code, the line: 
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherText, passwordWordArray, cipherParams);

must be replaced by: 
var cipherParamsCipherText = CryptoJS.lib.CipherParams.create({
    ciphertext: cipherText
});
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherParamsCipherText, passwordWordArray, cipherParams);

since the decrypted-function expects a CipherParams-object as the first argument instead of a WordArray.
Alternatively, a Base64-encoded string can also be passed:
var cipherTextB64Enc = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(cipherText);   
var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherTextB64Enc, passwordWordArray, cipherParams);

Test: The C#-code provides for the following input:
byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"");
string password = ""0123456789012345""; // 16 byte -> AES-128
string vector = ""5432109876543210"";   // 16 byte

the following byte-array as ciphertext:
170, 27, 161, 209, 42, 247, 234, 191, 38, 167, 22, 74, 34, 139, 115, 0, 75, 207, 119, 161, 97, 142, 179, 93, 41, 12, 177, 128, 52, 151, 75, 231, 76, 157, 14, 197, 59, 111, 63, 206, 136, 218, 189, 244, 116, 43, 25, 20

If the modified JavaScript-code is tested with those data:
var encrypted = [170,27,161,209,42,247,234,191,38,167,22,74,34,139,115,0,75,207,119,161,97,142,179,93,41,12,177,128,52,151,75,231,76,157,14,197,59,111,63,206,136,218,189,244,116,43,25,20]; // byte[]
var vector = ""5432109876543210""    // string
var password = ""0123456789012345""; // string

it is decrypted correctly.
In the test AES-128 has been used. It can be switched to AES-256 by simply using a 32-byte key instead of a 16-byte key.

I think this library add random salt on my password .
How to disable this feature ?     
","AES is designed to generated random output that are symmetrical (That can be decrypted)
CryptoJS AES uses Math.random() calls to generate a matrix/salt during cyphering and this randomness is included in the encrypted result, that's how decrypt can ""uncypher"" the encrypted data.
You can either fork the CryptoJS Library and replaces Math.random usage by your own seed or you can change the outcome of Math.random at runtime for the duration of the encryption. 
Thanks to Javascript, you can assign custom code to native function.
Here is Option #2. It will always return the same output, it uses the function fakeMathRandom. This will temporarily change the outcome of Math.random for the duration of the callBack function
fakeMathRandom function
function fakeMathRandom(callBack) {
     if(!callBack) throw new Error(""Must provide callBack function"");
     //fake predefined output setup
     let seed=0;
     const randomOutputs = [0.04,0.08,0.15,0.16,0.23,0.42,0.52,0.65,0.79,0.89];
     //save nativeFunction
     const Math_random = Math.random;
     //change nativeFunction
     Math.random = function() {return randomOutputs[seed++ % 10];}
     //runs the callback
     const callbackOutput = callBack();
     //restore nativeFunction
     Math.random = Math_random; 
     return callbackOutput;
}

Usage
var encrypted = fakeMathRandom(() => CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, key));

Complete Demo Code:


function fakeMathRandom(callBack) {
  if(!callBack) throw new Error(""Must provide callBack function"");
	let seed=0;
  const randomOutputs = [0.04,0.08,0.15,0.16,0.23,0.42,0.52,0.65,0.79,0.89];
  const Math_random = Math.random;
  Math.random = function() {return randomOutputs[seed++ % 10];}
  const callbackOutput = callBack();
  Math.random = Math_random;
  return callbackOutput;
}

var text = ""Text to crypt!!!."";
var key  = 'secret';

var encrypted = fakeMathRandom(() => CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, key)); //This will always return U2FsdGVkX18KPXCjFHrhR4Q5zBbjCf+I/m/w9jbS3EuvE59kzUxK45FrGHDpqalt
var encrypted2 = fakeMathRandom(() => CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(text, key));

","Look at this line of code:
var myString = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, myPassword);

myString isn't a string.  I believe it's a CipherParams object.  (Reading from the documentation here.)  You're then trying to make that object a field in the database:
messages.push({
        displayName: user.displayName,
        userId: userId,
        pic: userPic,
        text: myString,
        timestamp: new Date().getTime() // unix timestamp in milliseconds
})

This isn't going to work.  You need to store a string instead of an object there.  Try calling toString() the return value of encrypt() to store a string that you can later convert back to whatever you need:
messages.push({
        displayName: user.displayName,
        userId: userId,
        pic: userPic,
        text: myString.toString(),
        timestamp: new Date().getTime() // unix timestamp in milliseconds

"54701686","Matching CryptoJS.SHA256() with hashlib.sha256() for a JSON","As a part of IEFT standard, I need to hash the body of a JSON request.
I have a reference code in JS that is known to produce the right hash, but now I'm stuck with matching the result in Python.
The JSON body:
body = {""description"":""Test ticket""}

The JS code:
bodyHash = CryptoJS.SHA256(body).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64)

Please note it's not JSON.stringify(body)! The ""correct"" hash (the one I'm looking to match):
TqXFCKZWbnYkBUP4/rBv1Fd3e+OVScQBZDav2mXSMw4=

The Python solution should be along the lines of:
body_hash = base64.b64encode(hashlib.sha256(repr(body).encode('utf-8')).digest()).decode('ascii')

Which produces something different:

In Java I've used PKCS5Padding padding. I have tried this with NoPadding as well, but in that case the de-crypted text is simply empty. Also, when trying with NoPadding, CryptoJS code is not working properly. As, this API should work for any client side program (Later I'm planning to expand this to PHP, .Net and R as well), I want to have a common, working mechnism for encryption of passwords thru AES.

EDIT:
While my question is still a source of curiosity for me, I have just found a whole branch of replies here on stack which involve a specific method within Google Apps Script I didn't know about: a built in Class Utility for creating HMAC Sha256 signature.
This may not be the very answer to my question in terms of theoretical knowledge, but will probably solve my problem from a practical point of view; so I will look into that now.
Thanks
Generate a keyed hash value using the HMAC method with Google Apps Script
How to get Hex value from computeHmacSha256Signature method of Google Apps Script?
get back a string representation from computeDigest(algorithm, value) byte[]
","
You want to retrieve the value of 8b5f48702995c1598c573db1e21866a9b825d4a794d169d7060a03605796360b from CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(""message"", ""secret"") using Google Apps Script.

If my understanding is correct, how about directly calculating the value using the methods of Google Apps Script? In this case, CryptoJS is not used. Please think of this as just one of several answers.
Sample script:
var res = Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature(""message"", ""secret"")
  .map(function(e) {return (""0"" + (e < 0 ? e + 256 : e).toString(16)).slice(-2)}).join("""");
Logger.log(res)

Result:
8b5f48702995c1598c573db1e21866a9b825d4a794d169d7060a03605796360b

Note:
The important point for above script is as follows.

At Google Apps Script, the data which was encrypted by Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature() is the bytes array of the signed hexadecimal.
In your case, the bytes array is converted to the unsigned hexadecimal.

","Decoded consists of random bytes, which seem to be lazily generated (i.e. when they are required). Just printing the bytes will - by definition - not result in anything useful because the bytes have random values. JavaScript support is a bit tricky because JavaScript doesn't use the byte as primitive type (hence the word array).
To view the bytes first encode them to hexadecimals, and then print them.

I don't understand how to get the IV in javascript as in java, that is where I am majorly struck

IvParameterSpec ivParameterSpec = new IvParameterSpec(encKey);

In Java the encryption key is used as IV as well. To decrypt the data you should use the key as IV too. 
Please note using key as IV is bad practice and it may create security weakness. IV allows reusing the same key for multiple encryptions without creating an opening for the ""two-time  pad attack"". If the key is reused for multiple encryptions, IV needs to be unique for each encryption for the same key.

3) I'm taking that output, the encrypted token, and sending it as the value for the Authorization header in a HTTP request that's  parsed by AWS API Gateway, which takes that header and passes it to my Lambda function.
4) In the Lambda function:
const AES = require('crypto-js/aes');
const Utf8 = require('crypto-js/enc-utf8');

module.exports.authenticate = function authenticate(event, context, callback) {
...
  try {
    const token = event.authorizationToken;
    const decryptedToken = AES.decrypt(token, 'password').toString(Utf8);
    const parsedToken = JSON.parse(decryptedToken);
  }
  catch(error){
  // log error
  }
...
}

The result of the decryption is an empty string, and hence parsing to JSON fails.
Final notes
I'm calling .toString(Utf8) since according to this and this, the output of a decryption operation is a Word Array object, and I need to turn it back to it's original string form, which is supposed to be the stringified JSON token.
Also, I'm testing all this using Serverless offline plugin to emulate API Gateway locally.
","TL; DR: Pass an actual AES key encoded as hex using the -K flag.
If you read the documentation for openssl enc carefully you'll notice there is a difference between the -pass (-k) and -K flags - the first is literally a password, the second is an actual key.
If you use -pass, you're actually passing in an arbitrary string password that gets fed through an (obsolete and insecure) KDF, EVP_KDF.  If you use -K, you can pass a real AES key as a hex string.
Since EVP_KDF is insecure, I'd recommend the latter.

","You can use CryptoJS in the following way:
var decryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(cipherText, CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(key), 
{
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7 //default
});
console.log('Decrypted Data: ' + decrypted);

PKCS5 is not supported by this library but you should not be using it as it was designed for DES rather than AES. However if you dont want to change it then you can still use PKCS7 for decryption and it will work because the difference is in the block size both paddings supports. PKCS5 only works with 8-byte blocks whereas PKCS7 works with block sizes betwheen 1 and 255 bytes. DES uses block size of 8 bytes.

This is the decryption code with JS:
var crypto_test = require('crypto-js'); 
var bytes = crypto_test.AES.decrypt(encrypted_text, 'test_key');

This is the equivalent Python version that Im trying to create:
BS = 32
key = 'test_key'
dkey = hashlib.sha256(key.encode()).digest()
encodedEncrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted_text)
#block_size is 16
cipher = AES.new(dkey, AES.MODE_CBC, encodedEncrypted[:AES.block_size])
decrypted = _unpad(cipher.decrypt((encodedEncrypted[AES.block_size:])).decode('utf-8')

def _unpad(s):
    return s[:-ord(s[len(s)-1:])]

From the documentation of CryptoJS I found:

If a passphrase has been used instead of a key then It will use AES
256 by default. 
The mode is CBC.
The padding is PKCS7.

However Pycrypto by default is forcing me to use a 16 bytes IV not a 32 as the documentation from CryptoJS proposed..so Im a bit confused on the correct way to do the decryption here.. Also I saw in some documentation that CryptoJS applies to sha256 to passphrase..but still not sure about that ..
That code will not crash but will give an empty text..

Its pretty simple, here is sample code to go-ahead :

// Encryption
AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(data),your_encKey).toString();

// Decryption
AES.decrypt(userdata, your_encKey).toString(utf8);

","In your code, you reference the output from calling the MD5 function which, when passed to typeof returns its type as 'object'.
Though it seems poorly documented, you can reach the string representation of the MD5 value using:
console.log(CryptoJS.MD5('my message').toString())

which produces: ""8ba6c19dc1def5702ff5acbf2aeea5aa""
If you plan to run your code using NodeJS, you might consider its native crypto module rather than crypto-js.
const crypto = require('crypto')
const h = crypto.createHash('md5')
h.update('my message')
console.log(h.digest('hex'))

which also prints: ""8ba6c19dc1def5702ff5acbf2aeea5aa""
The benefit of using NodeJS' native crypto module here is that, like all native modules, it is bundled into the NodeJS runtime and so doesn't need to be loaded in from an external module.

"56194350","What's the correct/standard practice to authenticate a user after registration?","I'm trying to authenticate a user after registration. What's the correct or standard way to go about it?
Using this method as the way to implement it, in step 3, how can I generate the random hash to send to the users email? I see two different options:

crypto
JWT token

I'm currently using JWT for login, so would it make sense to use the same token for user verification? Why or why not, and if not, what's the correct way?
","The answer to your question of whether you should use a crypto hash or a token is neither.    
The hash you are generating to use as a verification method does not need to be cryptographically secure, it only needs to be a unique verification hash that is not easy to guess.
In the past I have used a v4 UUID with the UUID lib and it works just fine. You could also base64 some known piece of information about the user, like their id or email concatenated with something random, like the time in mircoseconds and a random hex string with substantial length, but honestly the time it takes to build out something like that is wasted when UUID v4 works just fine.    
Your hash also doesn't need to be unique (different for each user, yes, but avoid all potential collisions? No) - hitting an endpoint with only the hash is not a great idea. The endpoint should also take an identifier for your user combined with the verification hash. This way, you don't need to worry about the hash being unique in your datastore. Find user by ID, check that verification hashes match, verify. I would only suggest that you obfuscate the user's know information in a way that you can decode on your end (ex: base64 encode their user ID + email + some const string you use). 
[EDIT]    
Verifying or validating a user is really just asking them to prove that the email address (or phone number) they entered does in fact exist and that it belongs to the user. This is an attempt to make sure the user didn't enter the information incorrectly or that the registration is spam. For this we don't need cryptographic authentication, a simple shared secret is more than enough.   
When you store your user's registration data, you generate the shared secret you will use to verify the account. This can be anything that is (relatively) unique and contains enough length and entropy that it is not easy to be guessed. We aren't encoding or encrypting information that will be unpacked later, we are doing a literal string comparison to make sure the secret we provided to the user was echoed back to us intact. This is why a simple one-way hash is OK to use. I suggested a UUID v4 because the components of this hash are generated from random information (other versions of UUID make use of the machine's MAC or the time or other known pieces of information). You can use any method you like as long as it can't be easily decoded or guessed.    
After you generate the verification hash you send it to the user (in a nicely formatted URL that they only need to click) in order for them to complete their account registration. URL guidelines are totally up to you, but here are some suggestions:    
BAD 
/verify/<verification hash>
or
/verify?hash=<verification hash> 
With only the verification hash in the URL, you are relying on this value to be globally unique in your datastore. If you can reliably generate unique values that never contain collisions, then it would be OK, but why would you want to worry about that? Don't rely on the verification hash by itself.    
GOOD 
/users/<id>/verify/<verification hash>
or
/users/<id>?action=verify&hash=<verification hash> 
Out of these two examples you can see that the point is to provide two pieces of data, 1. is a way to identify the user, and 2. the verification hash you are checking.
In this process you start by finding the user in your datastore by ID, and then literally compare the secret you generated and stored against the value given in the URL. If the user is found and the verification hashes match, set their account to Active and you're good to go. If the user is found but the hashes don't match... either you provided a malformed URL or someone is trying to brute force your verification. What you do here is up to you, but to be safe you might regenerate the hash and send out a new email and try the process again. This leads very quickly into a black hole about how to prevent spam and misuse of your system, which is a different conversation.    
The above URL schemas really only work if your user IDs are safe for public display. As a general rule you should never use your datastore IDs in a URL, especially if they are sequential INTs. There are many options for IDs that you would use in a URL like UUID v1 or HashIDs or any implementation of a short ID.    
ALSO 
A good way to see how this is done in the wild is to look at the emails you have received from other systems asking you to verify your own email address. Many may use the format:
/account/verify/<very long hash> 
In this instance, the ""very long hash"" is usually generated by a library that either creates a datastore table just for the purpose of account verification (and the hash is stored in that table) or is decoded to reveal a user identifier as well as some sort of verification hash. This string is encoded in a way that is not easily reversible so it can not be guessed or brute forced. This is typically done by encoding the components with some sort of unique salt value for each string.    
NOTE - while this method may be the most ""secure"", I only mention this because it is based on the typical methods used by third-party libs which do not make assumptions about your user data model. You can implement this style if you want, but it would be more work. My answer is focused your intent to do basic verification based on data in your user model. 
BONUS 
Many verification systems are also time constricted so that the verification URL expires after some period of time. This is easily able to be set up by also storing a future timestamp with your user data that is checked when the verification endpoint is hit and the user is found. What to do when an expired link is clicked is up to you, but the main benefit is to help you more easily clean up dead registrations that you know cannot be verified.

I have a seemingly straightforward piece of code which takes a plainText and encrypts it using AES with a key and an initial vector.

This is the snippet:
const { enc, AES } = require(""crypto-js"");

const decrypt = AES.decrypt(hashTextCopy, KEY, { iv: IV });
const decryptText = decrypt.toString(enc.Utf8);

console.log(`""${hashTextCopy}"" was decrypted to ""${decryptText}""`);

PS: The version I am using is ""crypto-js"": ""^3.1.9-1"",
","Maybe try changing your code ever so slightly, this works for me.
As stated in the comments, I believe the problem with your initial example was the key length.
const { enc, AES } = require(""crypto-js"");

// Keep as a string..
const KEY = ""this is a key"";
const IV = enc.Utf8.parse(""this is initial vector"");

const originalText = ""someone@example.com"";

const hash = AES.encrypt(originalText, KEY, { iv: IV });
const hashText = hash.toString();

console.log(`""${originalText}"" was encrypted to ""${hashText}""`);

const hashTextCopy = `${hashText}`;
const decrypt = AES.decrypt(hashTextCopy, KEY, { iv: IV });
const decryptText = decrypt.toString(enc.Utf8);

console.log(`""${hashTextCopy}"" was decrypted to ""${decryptText}""`);

This also works:
const { enc, AES } = require(""crypto-js"");

// 128-bit key works nicely
const KEY = enc.Hex.parse(""000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"");
const IV = enc.Utf8.parse(""this is initial vector"");

const originalText = ""someone@example.com"";

const hash = AES.encrypt(originalText, KEY, { iv: IV });
const hashText = hash.toString();

console.log(`""${originalText}"" was encrypted to ""${hashText}""`);

const hashTextCopy = `${hashText}`;
const decrypt = AES.decrypt(hashTextCopy, KEY, { iv: IV });
const decryptText = decrypt.toString(enc.Utf8);

console.log(`""${hashTextCopy}"" was decrypted to ""${decryptText}""`);

The key: 
const KEY = enc.Utf8.parse(""abcdfghi"");

Will also work correctly (since it's 128-bits). 256 would work too.
const KEY = enc.Utf8.parse(""abcdfghijklmnopq"");

If you just use a pass phrase, a 256-bit key will be generated from it.

","The error is coming from this section:
reader.onload = function(evt) {

The problem is that this refers to the wrong object. Your onload handler is a different function from the surrounding code and whenever you enter a new function the value of this changes.
There are several possible solutions.
Aliasing this:
const that = this;

reader.onload = function(evt) {
    that.callbackRead(that, file, evt, callbackProgress, callbackFinal);
};

Binding this:
reader.onload = function(evt) {
    this.callbackRead(this, file, evt, callbackProgress, callbackFinal);
}.bind(this);

Using an arrow function, which won't alter the value of this:
reader.onload = evt => {
    this.callbackRead(this, file, evt, callbackProgress, callbackFinal);

Here is the relevant part of the Mongoose schema using the encryption getter and setter:
...
email: {
  type: Schema.Types.String,

  trim: true,
  unique: true, // <-- this does not work due to encryption
  set: value => this._encryption.encrypt(value),
  get: value => this._encryption.decrypt(value)

....

As you can see, the field is using the unique attribute. But due to the encryption, the encrypted value of the same email address is always different. Now I can store two different users using the same email address and no errors are thrown.
How do I use encryption along with a unique field attribute?
","I would suggest perhaps doing the encryption / setting outside of the schema. The get method will still be fine.
This way you can firstly encrypt the new email coming in.
const encryptedEmail= _encryption.encrypt(email);
Then you can do a search to make sure that this hash does not exist:
const email = await emailSchema.findOne({email: encryptedEmail});
if (!email.length) {
    emailSchema.create({ email: encryptedEmail});
}

This is obviously not as clean as doing it within the schema however it would achieve the desired encryption at rest.

In order to display 3d models on the web, the client needs to fetch the files from the server (the 3d mesh and the texture images)
But I don't want my visitors being able to access any of these files. I hope you can point me in the right direction. Here are some ideas I had, but I don't think they'll work:
(1) Using something like crypto-js to encrypt and decrypt files

But when decrypting files on the frontend aren't users able to decrypt the files, too?
The key has to be transferred to the frontend code somehow, doesn't it?

(2) Splitting the files up into little pieces and recomposing them on the client

Same issue as with #1
The code for recomposition needs to sit on the client and can be used to access the files


When elaborating on those ideas, I am not quite sure if what I am trying to do is even possible 🤔
In case it is impossible... is there anything I can do to make it really hard for users to get access to the files?
","The short answer is: If it is on a website, you don't stand a chance to protect it against a determined person with enough time on their hands. The only exception here was made for video-streams, which can use the 'Encrypted Media Extensions' API to get video to the screen without any parts of the browser being able to interact with raw data.
Whatever you do to protect the files, the code to read them needs to be sent to the browser as well. Eventually, the raw data will be somewhere in the memory of the js-runtime where it can be extracted using the built-in debugger. The same goes for any mechanism to somehow encrypt the code. It makes it more difficult, but not impossible. You could use WebAssembly to make that part of the code even harder to reverse-engineer, but I wouldn't need to do that:
In the end, the data needs to get to the webgl-api, so I could just use a browser-extension to intercept the relevant webgl-calls and obtain all the raw data there. You could go on and also encrypt the vertex-data in a way that can be decoded in the vertex-shader, but guess what: I can read the vertex-shader code as well.
And so the list goes on. There just is just no way to do it that cannot be somehow circumvented. But maybe you make it difficult enough for nobody to bother...
For me the most promising options seem to be:

use LoFi or partial models for rendering in the browser alongside renders of the full-resolution model. I've seen that on several sites for downloading CAD-/3D-models. They used merged models, sometimes reduced vertex-count, low-res textures and so on while providing images of what the final result will look like once I paid for it.
make up your own file-format or hide the file-format used in the network-view of the developer-tools. Google maps/earth for instance does that with their 3d-data (they are probably using something based on protobuf, but it's incredibly hard to reverse-engineer)
and yes, I guess you could also use the WebCrypto-API with a pre-shared secret so it is at least not too obvious which of the files contain the 3d-data.

"56997283","Problems understanding Bit length and String Bitt things in Javascript/Typescript with Crypto-JS","I am a little lost on this one...
I have a special key i need to send to a device in a specified format, and i know that what i am doing is wrong - obviously, because i lack the basic understanding of bit stuff in Javascript, i think.
The first step is to generate a random 128 bit number.
Since afaik JS characters are 16 bit, the following code should generate a 128 bit string, doesn't it?
private generateSeed()
{
  let result = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    result += ((Math.random() * 10) - 1).toString();

  return result;
}

After that i need to concatenate the seed and the key, calculate the SHA1 of that and padd that SHA1 to 192 bit with zeroes.

private generateAKey(seed: string)
  {
    const Provided_KEY = '[32 random characters are in here]';
    let concat = seed + Provided_KEY;

    let sha1 = crypto.SHA1(concat).toString();
    console.log(`SHA1: ${sha1} , Length: ${sha1.length}`);

    // Padd to 192 bit/24 bytes
    while(sha1.length < 12)
      sha1 += '0';

    return sha1;
  }

But i am totally lost here. I am pretty sure i am wrong with that.
Also since the SHA1 i calculate with crypto-js is already 40 characters long this makes no sense for me.
How do i correctly do this?

","The key needs to be stored inside an httpOnly cookie, a special kind of cookie that’s only sent in HTTP requests to the server, and it’s never accessible (both for reading or writing) from JavaScript running in the browser.

","I would start by first implementing a transform stream (or utilize an existing library) to read the file line-by-line.
function toLines() {
    let line = '';
    return new Transform({
        decodeStrings: false,
        readableObjectMode: true,

                line = lines.shift();
            }

            callback();
        },
        flush(callback) {
            if (line) {
                this.push(line);
            }
            callback();
        }
    });
}

Then I would implement a transform stream for encrypting each line.
function encryptLines(algorithm, derivedKey, iv) {
    return new Transform({
        readableObjectMode: false,
        writableObjectMode: true,
        transform(line, encoding, callback) {
            const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, derivedKey, iv);
            this.push(cipher.update(line, encoding, 'base64'));
            this.push(cipher.final('base64'));
            this.push('\n');
            callback();
        }
    });
}

Then then you can simply pipe everything to the output stream (as desired).
fs.createReadStream('input.txt', {encoding: 'utf8'})
    .pipe(toLines())
    .pipe(encryptLines(algorithm, derivedKey, iv))
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'))

var dateFixed = ""2019-10-22T11:33:13.393Z"";
var fixedDateBytes = stringToBytes(dateFixed);
var sha1Password= CryptoJS.SHA1(""password"");
console.log(""sha1Password"",sha1Password.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex));

var sha1PasswordBytes= wordArrayToByteArray(sha1Password, 20);

var concatedBytes= fixedDateBytes.concat(sha1PasswordBytes);

var finalShaPassWords= CryptoJS.SHA1(concatedBytes); 
console.log(""finalShaPassWords"",finalShaPassWords.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex));

console.log(""finalShaPassWords"",finalShaPassWords.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64));

However unfortunatelly Base64 representations written in those 2 languages doesnt match. 
I have checked and bytes from date are equal. Bytes from hashed password are not. So hashing after concat fails in JavaScript. 
I have checked first password hashing and generated bytes and both of them are the same. So my guess line var sha1PasswordBytes= wordArrayToByteArray(sha1Password, 20); causes that line  var finalShaPassWords= CryptoJS.SHA1(concatedBytes); returns bad value. 
Can someone give me some idea what is wrong? Mayby it should be written diffrent ? 
","Since you are using CryptoJS anyway, you can also use the CryptoJS encoders and the WordArray#concat-method, which considerably simplifies the code:
var CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");

// Input
var inPwd = ""password"";
var inDate = ""2019-10-22T11:33:13.393Z"";

// Processing
var pwdHash = CryptoJS.SHA1(inPwd);                                         // hash and convert to WordArray
var date = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(inDate);                                 // convert to WordArray
var joinedData = date.clone().concat(pwdHash);                              // join date and hashed password
var joinedDataHash = CryptoJS.SHA1(joinedData);                             // hash joined data
var joinedDataHashB64 = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(joinedDataHash);      // convert to Base64 string

// Output
console.log(""Result: "" + joinedDataHashB64 );                              // Output: D235TBTZMfpSyB/CDl5MHAjH5fI=

The output of this code is the same as the output of the Java-code: D235TBTZMfpSyB/CDl5MHAjH5fI=

From the documentation and tutorials online I understood that crypto will convert the string of my salt to a buffer by itself, but this error makes me think otherwise.
Am I missing any steps in using pbkdf2 maybe?

","If you call randomBytes (I assume it is crypto.randomBytes) with a callback, then the process is made asynchronously. So when pbkdf2 is called, this.salt hasn't been initialized yet.
Either move the call to pbdkf2 inside the randomBytes' callback, or use the implicitly synchronous version:
try {
  this.salt = randomBytes(saltLength);
} catch (err) {
  // handle err here
}

I have an Android Java piece of code that do the encrypt algorithm i want to replicate.
In react-native I added ""CryptoJS"" from https://github.com/brix/crypto-js and I called CryptoJS.enc.TripleDES.encrypt() method but it returns a different result than expected.
This is Android code i want to reach:
private static byte[] encrypt(String message, String privateKeyMobile) throws Exception {
  final MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""MD5"");
  final byte[] digestOfPassword = md.digest(privateKeyMobile.getBytes(""utf-8""));

  final byte[] keyBytes = new byte[24];
  int q;
  for (q = 0; q < 24 && q < digestOfPassword.length; q++) {
    keyBytes[q] = digestOfPassword[q];
  }
  if (q < 24) {
    for (int u = q; u < 24; u++)
      keyBytes[u] = 0;
  }
  for (int j = 0, k = 16; j < 8;) {
    keyBytes[k++] = keyBytes[j++];
  }

  final SecretKey key = new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, ""DESede"");
  final Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DESede/ECB/PKCS7Padding"");
  cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);

  final byte[] plainTextBytes = message.getBytes(""utf-8"");
  return cipher.doFinal(plainTextBytes);

  var ciphertext = TripleDES.encrypt(message, md5key, {
    mode: CryptoJS.mode.ECB,
    padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7
  });
  return ciphertext;
}

The two functions returns different outputs.

When I use the getPublicKey() method after setting the private key in bob.createECDH() the code works fine but in actual I will not have the utility of setPrivateKey() method for alice when I am on bob side. So I will have to pass the base58 public address instead of bob.getPublicKey() or alice.getPublicKey() on either side.
const alice_secret = alice.computeSecret('HEX_PUBLIC_KEY','hex');

Following is the full code for encryption and decryption.
const alice = crypto.createECDH('secp256k1');
const bob = crypto.createECDH('secp256k1');
bob.setPrivateKey(""PRIVATE_KEY_FOR_BOB"", ""hex"");
alice.setPrivateKey(""PRIVATE_KEY_FOR_ALICE"", ""hex"");

const alice_secret = alice.computeSecret(bob.getPublicKey());
console.log(""alice's shared Key: "" + alice_secret.toString('hex') + ""\n"");

var algo = 'aes-256-ecb', plainText = ""Some secret to share bob"";
var cipher = crypto.createCipher(algo, alice_secret)
var encrypted = cipher.update(plainText, 'utf8', 'hex')
encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
console.log(""Encrypted: "" + encrypted);

const bob_secret = bob.computeSecret(alice.getPublicKey());
console.log(""bob's shared Key: "" + bob_secret.toString('hex') + ""\n"");

var decipher = crypto.createDecipher(algo, bob_secret)
var decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8')
decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
console.log(""Decrypted: "" + decrypted);

if (plainText == decrypted) {
    console.log(""ECDH Success"")
}

The output is expected when I use setPrivateKey() and then use getPublicKey()

// Transform them to PEM.

","You are trying to do the PKCS1-padding (RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5) manually. But this isn't necessary. It's enough to concatenate the Hash-ID (here for SHA-256) and your data (fingerprint), the rest is done by the implicitly selected padding (crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING), i.e.
// Signing
var fingerprint = Buffer.from('2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824','hex');
var id = Buffer.from([0x30, 0x31, 0x30, 0x0d, 0x06, 0x09, 0x60, 0x86, 0x48, 0x01, 0x65, 0x03, 0x04, 0x02, 0x01, 0x05, 0x00, 0x04, 0x20]);
var allData = Buffer.concat([id, fingerprint]);
var signature = crypto.privateEncrypt(privateKey, allData); // crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_PADDING by default

// Verifying with createVerify
var verify = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA256');
verify.update('<the signed data>'); 
var verified = verify.verify(publicKey, signature); // provides true

// Verifying with publicDecrypt
var decryptedFingerprint = crypto.publicDecrypt(publicKey, Buffer.from(signature)).slice(-32); // provides fingerprint

Note: If you want to do the padding manually, you have to set the byte sequence 0x00 || 0x01 || PS || 0x00 before the allData-buffer. PS consists of as many 0xff-bytes as necessary to reach the key length (in bytes). In addition, the flag 
crypto.constants.NO_PADDING must be set explicitly in the privateEncrypt-call. However, this isn't necessary, since the result is the same. The details are described in RFC 8017, Section 8.2.1

","No SHA-256 hash can have only 8 byte positions. The output, as the name suggests, should be 256 bits or 32 bytes. What I suspect to happen is that the input of stringify is already presumed to be bytes, while CryptoJS functions return a WordArray of 32 bit words. As 8 * 32 = 256 this seems reasonable.
So I presume you can simply fix this by using a function on the WordArray instead, for instance hash.toString('hex').

","It looks like your initial string is Base64 Encoded. It's possible that cryptoJS.AES or some other process is taking the encrypted bytes and storing them as Base64 in the database.
Your databases decrypt routine is probably assuming the raw bytes, so you'll need to turn the Base64 string (check the net for mysql's base64 routines) into the actual bytes and then pass them to the AES_DECRYPT function.

to compare the hashes(hashed password in database vs hashed input password) always returning false
so i did more digging  to find out the contents of the hashes and these are the results.
const crypto = require('crypto')
function setUserPassword(inputPassword){
    const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')
  let hashedPassword = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(inputPassword, salt, 1000, 16,'sha512').toString('hex')
   return{ //we shall store them in the database later
     salt: salt,
     hashedPassword: hashedPassword
   }
}
database ====>ac0f74b30c94fedbbd591889c4705607  //works perefectly using the above function

challenge comes when validating the user password.. using this function..
   function validateUserPassword(enteredPassword, dbSalt, dbPassword){

// then checks if this generated hash is equal to user's hash in the database or not 
   let hashInput = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(enteredPassword, dbSalt, 1000,16, 'sha512') //the same as above

   //u must compare the hashed password in the db with hashedInput password
   return hashInput === dbPassword //IF it returns true then they match
}
so i checked the  hashInput and discovered that it was a buffer instead of the string... 
hey hashed input password  <Buffer ac 0f 74 b3 0c 94 fe db bd 59 18 89 c4 70 56 07>

//may nodejs version... v6.11.4 and alo tried using v10.15.0 but all in  the vain.

","In setUserPassword() you're creating a hex-encoded string from the buffer returned by the hash function, but you're forgetting to do the same in validateUserPassword(). This will fix it:
let hashInput = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(enteredPassword, dbSalt, 1000,16, 'sha512').toString('hex')

I create a docker secret with the private key, and use it inside the container, but then I get :
Host key verification failed.

hint #1 : gitlab.com is not a known host
After search, I have found this answer, and I have added the host fingerprint inside the .ssh/known_hosts file :
ssh-keyscan -H gitlab.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

But nothing has changed
hint #2 : the keys are wrong
To test the key pair, I have logged this :
const {
  publicKey,
  privateKey,
} = await createSShKeys();

console.log('#PUBLIC KEY');
console.log(publicKey);

console.log('#PRIVATE KEY');
console.log(privateKey);


And I have stored the private key in a file. I try to verify it with :
$ ssh-keygen -y -t private_key
bad key type

the generated private key is as follow
https://pastebin.com/2JC7kz9r
Has anyone already generated keys with crypto and sshpk with success ?
Or encoutered similar problem ?
Thank you for your help ! :)
","The problem was really the key of the host, not the generated keys.
But the ""clean"" method doesn't work :
ssh-keyscan -H gitlab.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

The only working method is append these lines on /etc/ssh/ssh_config:
Host *
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

I don't know why. (if anyone have idea ?)
But finaly, the keys are okay, it's probably a mistake on copy/paste (Lol)
Thank you all !

Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(rijndael.IV).Replace(""-"","""").ToLower());
//Output rijndael.IV = 063ead20a9d5f35ab83e1156ebe7c099

with a CryptoJS i can get a same KEY as C# but with the IV i don't get it why the value is not match
CryptoJS code:
let key = CryptoJS.PBKDF2('password', '20190925', {keySize:256/32, iterations:1000})
console.log('key', key.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex))
//Output key =  'key', 'c1b34ea814586db4a22dad37e11c7256322ab0eee3a14ed1898f93d7a264242f'

console.log('iv', iv.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex))
//Output iv =  'iv', 'c1b34ea814586db4a22dad37e11c7256'

I just think if rijndael.IV = pdb.GetBytes(16); will just get half of rijndael.Key = pdb.GetBytes(32); hex, but the value totally different
is there a way to match IV of C# using CryptoJS?
","PBKDF2 must be executed for a length equal to the sum of key length and IV length. The result is divided into two parts. The first part corresponds to the key, the second part to the IV:
let keyLen = 256/32
let ivLen = 128/32
let keyiv = CryptoJS.PBKDF2('password', '20190925', {keySize:keyLen + ivLen, iterations:1000})
let key = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(keyiv.words.slice(0, keyLen));
let iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(keyiv.words.slice(keyLen, keyLen + ivLen));
console.log('keyiv:', keyiv.toString())
console.log('key  :', key.toString())
console.log('iv   :', iv.toString())

This results in:
keyiv: c1b34ea814586db4a22dad37e11c7256322ab0eee3a14ed1898f93d7a264242f063ead20a9d5f35ab83e1156ebe7c099

iv   : 063ead20a9d5f35ab83e1156ebe7c099

which matches the result of the C# code.

//Encrypt Data
var encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(jsonStr, 'secret_passcode');

//Convert OBJ to String so I can save it
var encryptedString  = encrypted.toString();
$.writeln('encryptedString is ' + encryptedString);

//Decrypt string - DOES NOT WORK IN EXTENDSCRIPT
var decryptedValue1= CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedString, 'secret_passcode');
$.writeln('decryptedValue1 is ' +  decryptedValue1);

var decryptedValue2= CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, 'secret_passcode');
$.writeln('decryptedValue2 is ' +  decryptedValue2);

//Final Decrypt output from string
$.writeln('finalOutput from  decryptedValue1 is ' + decryptedValue1.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

//Final Decrypt output from obj
$.writeln('finalOutput from  decryptedValue2 is ' + decryptedValue2.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8));

I'm guessing the issue is Extendscript using ES3. Any suggestions on how I can convert the encrypted data to a string (so I can store it as JSON) and then still be able to decrypt it? Obviously being able to store data I can't decrypt does me no good.

const cipher = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(plaintext, key)

If I use cipher.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Base64), then the web crushes, and says ""TypeError: wordArray.clamp is not a function"". It seems that only toString() without any parameters can work for me, so I want to know the default encoder for toString() method for decrypting in backend.
","You appear to be confusing an encrypted data object and a decrypted data object. The toString method on each of these work differently and have different argument requirements.
var CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");

// Encrypt
var ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('my message', 'secret key 123');

// Decrypt
var bytes  = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(ciphertext.toString(), 'secret key 123');
var plaintext = bytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);

console.log(plaintext);

In the above example code, ciphertext is set to an object containing the encrypted data. The toString method on that object does not accept CryptoJS.enc objects as an argument. The encrypted data in the object only takes one form so there's no reason to need to specify an encoding.
Also in the above example code, bytes is set to an object containing the decrypted data. The toString method on that object requires an CryptoJS.enc object as an argument in order to know how to interpret what is otherwise just binary data.

Is there a way to differentiate between the various AJAX calls that my application is making vs say a developer in the console who would try and make those calls manually?
My thought was that my application would send some sort of payload with each type of request so that the server could check for said payload and know it was the app making the call. Problem is, I'm not sure how the app itself can both generate that payload on the fly (i.e. not me sending a string of data that's hard-coded in the JS) while keeping it secret. I looked into crypto-js, but it seems that I would have to store the key in my code somewhere which would just defeat the purpose. I hope I just said all that correctly.

$ivKey = 'somesecretkeytxt';
$token = 'BD';
$cipher = ""AES-128-CBC"";
$ciphertext_raw = openssl_encrypt($token, $cipher, $secretKey, false, $ivKey);

let ivKey = 'somesecretkeytxt';

i expect the same output for encryption, someone can figure out this?
","For the PHP-code, code and output are inconsistent. The current code returns the output 50CqXivvXXTfw276AZ8IjA== (the posted output is only obtained if key and IV are swapped).
In the JavaScript-code key and IV must be passed as WordArray, e.g. 
let secretKey = CryptoJS.enc.Latin1.parse(""..."");

Currently the key is passed as string and therefore interpreted as passphrase, from which key and IV are generated (see The Cipher Input).

","CryptoJS stores all data in a data structure called WordArray. Each ""word"" stores 32 bit (4 byte). A key size of 4 in CryptoJS means a key size of 128 bit or 16 byte everywhere else.
APIs are generally written differently and most of the time, you don't have the exact same object that represent the same data in the same way across programming languages. 
C# works with byte arrays. So, you will need to create a key that has 16 bytes in it. Keep in mind that MD5 always produces 128 bit output (16 bytes), so you probably don't have to do anything special.

Javascript part:
if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
    let reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = (e) => {
       let data = e.target.result;

    reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0]);
}

However, the code above gives me different hash as terminal does (md5sum ).Terminal gives me the same hash as various online converters.
It is the same with SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms I tried.
Example:
This image from Wikipedia gives the following hashes.
Terminal: e5d23cb99614778b2acb163b8ee90810
CryptoJS: 468641711626fcfe6d956ddb21ccd4c7
","readAsDataURL() is going to return a base64 string (with a data URI preamble) so that's what your hashing however an MD5 terminal tool is just going to read the raw bytes & hash them as-is.  
To fix use:
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(input.files[0]);

to fetch the raw bytes and:
var hashed = CryptoJS.MD5(CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.create(data));

to pass them to CryptoJs in a format it can process.

"57327265","Key and IV visible in ciphertext object using CryptoJS library","I am trying to encrypt/decrypt some text using the CryptoJS library.
What I've done so far is, I generate a random key and iv and then I call the AES.encrypt function to encrypt the text.
For example
const key = this.generateRandomBytes(32);
const iv = this.generateRandomBytes(16);
let ciphertext = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(""secretMessage"", key, { iv: iv });
console.log(ciphertext);

What I noticed is that the ciphertext object contains the key and IV, so if I do ciphertext.iv I can get the iv value.
This means that by sending the ciphertext object, an attacker could get the iv and key values and decrypt the message.
Is it normal behavior?
Example:
key: rGV5ig6haSCITFt3qijtz6upLRwqqTYc

I've tried googling it but cannot seem to find how to do that in Python.
Javascript example:
var CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");

var hash = ""c8f3ab9777da89748851932d3446b197450bb12fa9b9136ad708734291a6c60c"";

console.log(hash);

I cannot figure out how to get similar output with hmac and hashlib libraries in Python but I expect the output something like this:
{ words:
   [ -923554921,
     2010810740,
     -2007919827,
     877048215,
     1158394159,
     -1447488662,
     -687312062,
     -1851341300 ],
  sigBytes: 32 }

Update:
I need to have an output in the exact same format (spacing, indents, new lines) to produce a subsequent hash from the output.
","You can do this in Python but it's not builtin as part of any crypto library that I am aware of.
A simple implementation (requires Python 3):

hash = ""c8f3ab9777da89748851932d3446b197450bb12fa9b9136ad708734291a6c60c""

# Convert hex-encoded data into a byte array
hash_bytes = bytes.fromhex(hash)

# Split bytes into 4-byte chunks (32-bit integers) and convert
# The integers in your example a big-endian, signed integers
hash_ints = [
    int.from_bytes(hash_bytes[i:i+4], ""big"", signed=True) 
    for i in range(0, len(hash_bytes), 4)
]

# Print result
print({""words"": hash_ints, ""sigBytes"": len(hash_bytes)})

This will output: {'words': [-923554921, 2010810740, -2007919827, 877048215, 1158394159, -1447488662, -687312062, -1851341300], 'sigBytes': 32}
Hope that helps.

However, a major problem with this approach:
JSON FILE
{
    ""id"": ""12345"",
    ""apiKey"": ""foo""
}

JS FILE
if (jsonFile.id === ""123"" && jsonFile.apiKey === ""foo"") {
    return true;
} else {
    return false;
}

is that the user can change the values in the JS file to any value they want to put in the JSON file so they can authenticate anything.
One solution, I thought was using hashes with crypto, but the user can create a hash for any id or apiKey they want and change it in the files. The code will be obfuscated but I thought I would ask if there is a better way for this. 
I don't want the program that I give the user to be able to run different apiKey's or id's, only the ones I have defined in the program and they should not be able to change it.
Thanks in advance.
","Assuming your node.js file is running on your server and you are authenticating requests from your clients, then you should look at passport.js or another authentication library.  Credentials should never be passed to a server in clear text, but even if your client changes the credentials, it doesn't mean they'll get authenticated on the server, because the server authenticates using a database of registered users.  Your example suggests you are looking for ""bearer token"" authentication (apiKey), so here's a link to the passport-http-bearer docs on the passportjs.org website.

I've been trying to figure out how it could be using the wrong encoding data, as I have the hex and utf8 tags in the right places; I've been trying to look at other posts too, but I'm afraid they go over my head over how they're supposed to help me.
This is in the first file that I export it from

I use postman to test my localhost api, and am putting in 'bigthonks' as the password, when it console logs the enddata the Ciphored_password looks like:

and the Deciphored_password:

""\ufffd'\rF\ufffd\ufffd\¡\ufffd6>\ufffd\ufffd#B,0\u0005\u0007\ufffd?\ufffd;\ufffd\u0018\u001e\""oؕ""

","It turns out I'm an idiot... I missed one of the first steps of bugfixing which is looking at methodnames,
var crypto = require(""crypto"");

var secretkey = ""twinkies"";

    var finpass = mykey.update(pass, 'hex', 'utf8');
    finpass += mykey.final('utf8');
    return finpass;
}
};

on my decrypt method, when I'm generating the decipher for it i use the createCipher() method instead of the createDecipher() method, really big woops on my part.
I easily fixed it by changing the decrypt method to this: 
    decrypt: function(pass){
    var mykey = crypto.createDecipher('aes-128-cbc', secretkey);
    var finpass = mykey.update(pass, 'hex', 'utf8');
    finpass += mykey.final('utf8');

1. Avoid duplicate files
2. Avoid duplicate text code
I understand I need to calculate both the files and text codes into MD5 and maintain both into columns,
which can be queried, to check if the same file or text code might already be there in the application.
I am trying to find the correct way to create MD5 Checksums in NodeJs,
I found the following to be useful -
let crypto = require('crypto');
let md5CheckSum = crypto.createHash('md5').update(dataToConvert).digest(""hex"");

I have the following queries -

Is calculating MD5 and MD5 Checksum the same thing?
Is the code creating just an MD5, or is it also creating the checksum of the dataToConvert string?
if not how can I further create its checksum?
It is straightforward to pass text codes to the md5 function,
In case of files, what conversion do I need to do?
To be passed as an argument to the md5 checksum function?

Reference -
https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createhash_algorithm_options
","
yes
there is no such thing as ""an md5"", md5 checksums are cryptographic hashes of some data, so in this case that data is dataToConvert. No data, no md5.

"56414744","Adding headers to fetch, solving cors, running cryptojs client side","I'm working on a project where I need first to get a authentication token from a server. 
For this I need to send a GET request to the authorisation server with two key-value pairs included in the header: 1/ the client id (const) and 2/ a HMAC SHA1 calculated value based on client ID timestamp and so on. 
This is working fine with Postman. (I calculate the sha1 on an online calculator)
Problem 1: (cryptojs client side)
As a node app I included the cryptojs library and the calculation works. But even with RequireJS I can not get cryptojs to run in the browser.
Error: Module name ""crypto-js"" has not been loaded yet for context: _. Use require([])

Problem 2: (cors)
Apparently chrome refuses the connection as the server does not accept all incoming connections.
Adding mode: 'no-cors' to the fetch request does not solve the problem. 
Problem 3: (headers)
I need to add two key - value pairs to the get request headers. In postman this is no problem but I'm not sure this works with append or just adding them to my headers: { } 
I constantly get a server error as if no headers where added. 
I have already tried REquireJS for the cryptojs problem.
I have added the headers to a myHeaders object
const myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append('ClientID', CLIENTID);
myHeaders.append('Clientsecret', hashedToken);

and also just added the values to: 
headers: {
...
'ClientID': CLIENTID,
'Clientsecret': hashedToken,
}

Both don't seem to help.
My code:
function getToken(){

hashedToken = getHashedSecret();  //this won't work client side as    cryptojs can not be loaded
const CLIENTID = ""CLIENTID"";
const AUTHURL =  ""https://authorization.server.com/api/CLIENTID/authorization/"";
var TIMESTAMP = getTimeStamp();


const myHeaders = new Headers();
//  myHeaders.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
myHeaders.append('ClientID', CLIENTID);
myHeaders.append('Clientsecret', hashedToken);
 console.log(myHeaders);
let response = fetch(AUTHURL+TIMESTAMP, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    myHeaders,
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Origin': '',
    'Host': 'authorization.server.com',
    include: 'ClientID', CLIENTID

  },

 })

I should get a token from the server
","It sounds like https://authorization.server.com doesn't allow access from your page's origin. Remember that in browsers, the Same Origin Policy prevents scripts from one origin from requesting information from other origins by default. (postman, not being a browser, is not subject to this restriction). This is so that scripts on Site A (a malicious actor) can't steal your personal information from Site B (perhaps your online banking) by making requests (from your browser, thus with your authentication information) to Site B.
For this to work, server code at https://authorization.server.com will need to respond to requests from the browser using the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow access from your origin. You cannot do it from your client-side code (for obvious reasons).
Alternately, you can run a server on your origin, make the requests to that server, and it can make the requests to https://authorization.server.com and pass back the responses to you. Your server, not being a browser, is not subject to the SOP.

Why is my broswer getting frozen when the hashing starts and after hashing is finished browser operated normally.
As I know the broswers are single threaded is there a possible asynchronous approach to this.
What's the best approach in Angular 7 to handle this kind of costly processes.
Or is this is an issue with the library.

I have tried converting both encoded variables into HEX to compare them, but the JavaScript one is much longer. Even if I shorten the key length to 48 (384 -> 48 in the pbkdf2Sync() method), it's still wrong.

let final = crypto.createHash('md5').update(password + salt, 'ascii').digest('binary');

Here is what I got so far:
import { MD5, enc } from 'crypto-js';
let final = MD5(password + salt).toString(enc.Latin1);

I do not know how I can convert the ""ASCII"" part of password + salt. Am I missing something ?

The private key is generated with this OpenSSL command:
$ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out private_key.pem

Would the following be the correct Node code to sign a message:
import crypto from 'crypto'

const sign = (privateKey, messageString) => {
  const buffer = Buffer.from(messageString, 'utf8')
  const signature = crypto.sign('sha256', buffer, privateKey)
  return signature.toString('base64')
